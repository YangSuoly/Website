Supply Chain Theory</h2>
<p>Supply chains used to be viewed, at least by some managers, as
“necessary evils.”</p>
<p>By the end of the last century, however, the purpose of the supply
chain had begun to change as some firms discovered that supply chains
could be a source of competitive advantage, rather than simply a cost
driver.</p>
<p>The final chapter of this book is devoted to exploring how the tools
of supply chain theory are used in a few of these application
areas—electricity systems, health care, and public sector
operations.</p>

<h2 id="definiton-and-scope">1.2 Definiton and Scope</h2>
<p>Perhaps the most authoritative definition comes from the Council of
Supply Chain Management Professionals(CSCMP), who define supply chain
management as follows</p>
<p>Supply chain management encompasses the planning and management of
all activities involved in sourcing and procurement, conversion, and all
logistics management activities. Importantly, it also includes
coordination and collaboration with channel partners, which can be
suppliers, intermediaries, third party service providers, and customers.
In essence, supply chain management integrates supply and demand
management with in and across companies</p>
<p>These practices include a huge range of tasks, such as forecasting,
production planning, inventory management, warehouse location, supplier
selection, procurement, and shipping.</p>
<p>The terms “logistics” and “logistics management” are closely related
to “supply chain management,” and it can be difficult to draw a clear
distinction.</p>
<p>“supply chain management” includes logistics, as well as nonmovement
activities such as inventory management and procure-ment.</p>
<p>Supply chains are often represented graphically as a schematic
network that illustrates the relationships between its elements</p>
<p>A location in the network is referred to as a stage or node. The
links between stages represent some type of flow—typically, the flow of
goods, but sometimes the flow of information or money</p>
<p>The portion of the supply chain from which products originate (the
left-hand portion in Figure 1.1) is referred to as up stream, while the
demand end is referred to as downstream.</p>
<p>But today’s supply chains more closelyresemble the complex network in
Figure 1.1; each echelon may have dozens, hundreds,or even thousands of
nodes.</p>
<p>The ideal supply chain management model would globally optimize every
aspect of thesupply chain, but such a model is impossible both because
of the difficulties in modelingsome aspects of the supply chain
mathematically and because the resulting model wouldbe too large and
complex to solve ## 1.3 Levels of Decision-making in Supply Chain
Management</p>
<p>It is convenient to think about three levels of supply chain
management decisions: strategic,tactical, and operational. Three level
of supply chain management decisions: - strategic - tactical -
operational</p>
<h1 id="forecasting-and-demad-modeling">2. Forecasting and Demad
Modeling</h1>
<h2 id="introduction-1">2.1 Introduction</h2>
<p>Demand forecasting is one of the most fundamental tasks that a
business must perform <em>Advantage</em>: - Improving customer service
levels and by reducing costs related to supply–demand mismatches.
<em>Disadvantage</em> - biased or otherwise inaccurate forecasting
results in inferior decisions and thus undermines business
performance.</p>
<p>The goal of the forecasting models discussed in this chapter is to
estimate the quantityof a product or service that consumers will
purchase</p>
<p>Most classical forecasting techniquesinvolve time-series methods that
require substantial historical data. Some of these methodsare designed
for demands that are stable over time</p>
<p>However, products today have shorter and shorter life cycles, in part
driven by rapidtechnology upgrades for high-tech products. As a result,
firms have much less historicaldata available to use for forecasting,
and any trends that may be evident in historical datamay be unreliable
for predicting the future - Large quantities of historical data
available.</p>
<p>n Section 2.4, we discuss more recent approaches to forecastingdemand
using machine learning when we have large quantities of historical data
available - Inadequate historical data</p>
<p>n Sections 2.5–2.8, we discuss several methods that can be used to
predict demands for newproducts or products that do not have much
historical data.</p>
<p>To distinguish these methodsfrom classical time-series–based methods,
we call them demand modeling techniques. <strong>Demand
modeling</strong> techniques: - Quantitative</p>
<p>They all involve mathe-matical models with parameters that must be
calibrated. - Some popular methods</p>
<p>In contrast, some popular methodsfor forecasting demand with little
or no historical data, such as the Delphi method, rely onexperts’
qualitative assessments or questionnaires to develop forecasts. Demand
processes may exhibit various forms of nonstationarity over time. These
include the following:<br />
- <em>Trends</em>: Demand consistently increases or decreases over
time.<br />
- <em>Seasonality</em>: Demand shows peaks and valleys at consistent
intervals.<br />
- <em>Product life cycles</em>: Demand goes through phases of rapid
growth, maturity, and decline.</p>
<p>Moreover, demands exhibit random error—variations that cannot be
explained or predicted—and this randomness is typically superimposed on
any underlying nonstationarity superimpose: <em>vt.</em>
使重叠,使叠加</p>
<p>Classical forecasting methods use prior demand history to generate a
forecast.</p>
<p>assume that pastpatterns of demand will continue into the future,
that is, no trend is present. As a result, these techniques are best
used for mature products with a large amount of historical data</p>
<p>On the other hand, regression analysis and double and triple
exponential smoothing canaccount for a trend or other pattern in the
data. ### 2.2.1 Moving Average</p>
<p>The moving average method calculates the average amount of demand
over a given intervalof time and uses this average to predict the future
demand. The definition of Moving Average: <span class="math display">\[
D_t = I + \epsilon_t
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> is the mean or
"base" demand and <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span> is a
random error term.</p>
<p>$ most recent observed demands.== %%POSTFIX%%Theforecast for the
demand in p*</p>
<p>That is, the forecast is simply the arithmetic mean of the previous N
observations. This isknown as a simple moving average forecast of order
N. ### 2.2.2 Exponential Smoothing</p>
<p>Exponential smoothing is a technique that uses a weighted average of
all past data as thebasis for the forecast. <strong>Assumption</strong>:
- <em>Single exponential smoothing</em>: the demand process is
<em>stationary</em>; - <em>Double exponential smoothing</em>: there is a
trend; - <em>Triple exponential smoothing</em>: account for trends and
seasonality.</p>
<p>These methods all requireuser-specified parameters that determine the
relative weights placed on recent and olderobservations when predicting
the demand, trend, and seasonality These three weights arecalled,
respectively, the smoothing factor, the trend factor, and the
seasonality factor 1. Single Exponential Smoothing</p>
<p>The single exponential smoothing forecast includes all
pastobservations, These weights can be approximated with an exponential
function <span class="math inline">\(f(i) = αe^{−αi}\)</span>. 2. Double
Exponential Smoothing</p>
<p>Double exponential smoothing can beused to forecast demands with a
linear trend.</p>
<p>It places a weight of <span class="math inline">\(β\)</span> on the
most recent estimate of the slope(obtained by taking the difference
between the two most recent base signals) and a weight of <span
class="math inline">\(1 −β\)</span> on the previous estimate 3. Triple
Exponential Smoothing</p>
<p>Triple exponential smoothing can be usedto forecast demands that
exhibit both trend and seasonality. <em>Seasonality</em>: the demand
series has a pattern that repeats every <span
class="math inline">\(N\)</span> periods for some fixed <span
class="math inline">\(N\)</span>.</p>
<p>The idea behind smoothing with trend and seasonality is basically to
“de-trend” and “de-seasonalize” the time series by separating the base
signal from the trend and seasonalityeffects</p>
<p>Initializing triple exponential smoothing is a bit trickier than for
single or double expo-nential smoothing.</p>
<p>To do so, we usually need at least two entire seasons’ worth of
data(<span class="math inline">\(2N\)</span> periods), which will be
used for the initialization phase. One common method is toinitialize the
slope as</p>
<p>In other words, we take the per-period increase in demand between
periods 1 and <span class="math inline">\(N + 1\)</span>, and the
per-period increase between periods 2 and <span class="math inline">\(N
+ 2\)</span>, and so on; and then we take the average over those <span
class="math inline">\(N\)</span> values. ### 2.2.3 Linear Regression</p>
<p>Historical data can also be used to forecast demands by determining a
cause–effect rela-tionship between some independent variables and the
demand</p>
<p>In linear regression, the model specification assumes that the
dependent variable, Y , is alinear combination of the independent
variables.</p>
<p>To build a regression model, we need historical data
points—observations of both theindependent variable(s) and the dependent
variable. ## 2.3 Forecast Accuracy ### 2.3.1 MAD, MSE and MAPE</p>
<p>Measurements: - MAD: Mean Absolute Deviation - MSE: Mean Squared
Error - MAPE: Mean Absolute Percentage Error</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{MAD} &amp; =\frac{1}{n} \sum_{t=1}^n\left|e_t\right| \\
\mathrm{MSE} &amp; =\frac{1}{n} \sum_{t=1}^n e_t^2 \\
\mathrm{MAPE} &amp;= \frac{1}{n} \sum\limits_{t-i}^{n} \left|
\frac{e_t}{D_t}\right| \times 100
\end{aligned}
\]</span></p>
<p>If the mean of the forecast error, μe,equals 0, we say the
forecasting method is unbiased: It does not produce forecasts that
aresystematically either too low or too high.</p>
<p>MAD is sometimes preferred to MSE in real applicationsbecause it
avoids the calculation of squaring, though modern spreadsheet and
statisticspackages can compute either performance measure easily. ## 2.4
Machine Learning in Demand Forecasting ### 2.4.1 Introduction</p>
<p>The huge volume of data generated every day, the high velocityof data
creation, and the large variety of sources all make today’s business
informationenvironment different than it was only a decade ago.</p>
<p>Compared with classical forecastingmethods such as the time series
methods discussed in Section 2.2, machine learning modelsoften
significantly increase prediction accuracy. ## 2.4.2 Machine
Learning</p>
<p>machine learning (ML) refers to a set of algorithms that can learn
from andmake predictions about data</p>
<p>Both techniques fall into the overall field of data science, which
covers a wider range oftopics, including database design and data
visualization techniques.</p>
<p>In contrast, unsupervised learning explores relationships and
structures withinthe data without any known “ground truth” labels or
outputs.</p>
<p>Common supervised learning methods include linear regression (and its
nonlinear ex-tensions), kernel methods, tree-based models, support
vector machines (SVMs), and neuralnetworks</p>
<p>Graphical models involving hidden Markov models (or, in their
simplest form,mixture models) and Markov random fields also receive
considerable attention. 1. Linear regression 2. Tree-based models</p>
<p>The trees used for these two types of problems are referred to as
regression treesand classification trees, respectively. In demand
forecasting, regression trees have receivedmore attention because of
their simplicity and interpretability</p>
<p>However, in practice, the number of possible partitionsmay be too
large to enumerate. Therefore, it is common to use a binary splitting
methodcalled recursive partitioning, which generates two regions from
the original region at eachiteration.</p>
<p>researchershave developed methods that combine several trees to
enhance the prediction performance.These include random forests,
bagging, and boosting.</p>
<p>stock-keeping unit (SKU) sales 3. Support vector machines</p>
<p>SVMs are designed to partition the space ofinput variables into two
regions, i.e., to make a binary prediction about a given outputbased on
which region a given input vector falls into.</p>
<p>SVMs can be generalized to allow nonlinearities by mapping the input
space into ahigh-dimensional space using kernel functions.</p>
<p>Popular choices ofkernel functions include polynomials and radial
basis functions (RBFs) 4. Neural networks</p>
<p>A neural network consists of several nodes, also calledneurons,
arranged into layers.</p>
<p>The key challenge in fitting a neural network model is the
determination of the weights <span
class="math inline">\(\alpha_{0m}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\alpha_m\)</span>. This is usually done using some
sort of algorithm that modifies the weights as the network “learns”
right and wrong answers.</p>
<p>Suchdeep neural networks have led to huge advances in machine
learning, with great successesnot only in classification and prediction
problems such as image processing and demandforecasting, but also, when
coupled with reinforcement learning (RL), in solving decisionproblems
such as those in board games ## 2.5 Demand Modeling Techniques</p>
<p>they need tounderstand the life cycles and demand dynamics of their
products</p>
<p>It turns outthat classical forecasting techniques did not work well
with the company’s highly variable,short-life-cycle products, so the
firm introduced products at the wrong times in the wrongquantities. ##
2.6 Bass Diffusion Model</p>
<p>The sales patterns of new products typically go through three phases:
rapid growth, maturity,and decline</p>
<p>The premise of the Bass model is that customers can be classified
into innovatorsand imitators.</p>
<p>Thegoal of the Bass model is to characterize this behavior in an
effort to forecast the demand</p>
<p>Moreover, it attempts topredict two important dimensions of a
forecast: how many customers will eventually adoptthe new product, and
when they will adopt</p>
<p>Knowing the timing of adoptions is importantas it can guide the firm
to smartly utilize resources in marketing the new product. ### 2.6.1 The
Model</p>
<p>It assumes that <span class="math inline">\(P(t)\)</span>, the
probability that a given buyer makes an initial purchase at time <span
class="math inline">\(t\)</span> given that she has not yet made a
purchase, is a linear function of the number of previous buyers, that
is, <span class="math display">\[
P(t) = p + \frac{q}{m} D(t)
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(D(t)\)</span> is the
<em>cumulative demand</em> by time <span
class="math inline">\(t\)</span>. <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span>
and <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> represent the <em>coefficient
of imitation</em> and the <em>market size</em>.</p>
<p>This equation include two influence factors: - coefficient of
innovation, denoted <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, which is a
constant, independent of how many other customers have adopted the
innovation before time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>. - the
"contagion" effect between the innovators and the imitators, denoted
<span class="math inline">\(\frac{q}{m} D(t)\)</span>, which is
proportional to the number of customers who have already adopted by time
<span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>.</p>
<p>Our preference would be to have a closed-form expressionfor D(t).
Fortunately, this is possible:</p>
<p>In summary, by varying the values of p and q, we can represent
manydifferent patterns of demand diffusion ### 2.6.2 Discrete Time
Version</p>
<p>A discrete-time version of the Bass model is available. ### 2.6.3
Parameter Estimation</p>
<p>The Bass model is heavily driven by the parameters <span
class="math inline">\(m\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(q\)</span>.</p>
<p>However, because the Bass model is typically used for new products,
in most caseshistorical data are not available to estimate the
parameters.</p>
<p>Instead, m is typically esti-mated qualitatively, using judgment or
intuition from management about the size of themarket, market research,
or the Delphi method</p>
<p>The parameters <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(q\)</span> tend to be relatively consistent
withina given industry, so these can often be estimated from the
diffusion patterns of similarproducts. ### 2.6.4 Extensions</p>
<p>The original model has also been extendedin a number of ways. ## 2.7
Learning Indicator Approach</p>
<p>Product life cycles are becoming shorter and shorter, so it is
difficult to obtain enoughhistorical data to forecast demands
accurately. - Solution: leading indicators</p>
<p>One idea that has proven to work well insuch situations is the use of
leading indicators—products that can be used to predict thedemands of
other, later products because the two products share a similar demand
pattern</p>
<p>The idea is first to group the products into clusters so that all of
the products within a clustershare similar attributes.</p>
<p>Even though all of the products are on the market simultaneously,the
lag provides enough time so that supply chain planning for the products
in the clustercan take place based on the forecasts provided by the
leading indicator. Of course, correctlyidentifying the leading indicator
is critical. ## 2.8 Discrete Choice Models ### 2.8.1 Introduction to
Discrete Choice</p>
<p>In economics, discrete choice models involve choices between two or
more discrete alterna-tives</p>
<p>The idea behind discrete choice models is to build a statistical
model that predictsthe choice made by an individual based on the
individual’s own attributes as well as theattributes of the available
choices.</p>
<p>choice models are atthe aggregate (population) level and assume that
each decision-maker’s preferences arecaptured implicitly by that
model.</p>
<p>Discrete choice models take many forms, including binary and
multinomial logit, binaryand multinomial probit, and conditional
logit.</p>
<p>For a discrete choice model, the setof alternatives in the choice set
must be mutually exclusive, exhaustive, and finite.</p>
<p>Discrete choice models usuallyassume that the decision-maker is a
utility maximizer. That is, he will choose alternative iif and only if
<span class="math inline">\(U_{ni} &gt; U_{nj}\)</span> for all <span
class="math inline">\(j ∈I, j \neq i\)</span> ### 2.8.2 The Multinomial
Logit Model</p>
<p>Next we derive the multinomial logit model. (Refer to McFadden (1974)
or Train (2009)for further details of the derivation.) “Multinomial”
means that there are multiple optionsfrom which the decision-maker
chooses # 3. Deterministic Inventory Models ## 3.1 Introduction to
Inventory Modeling</p>
<p>These are all reasons that firms plan to hold inventory. In addition,
firms may holdunplanned inventory—for example, inventory of products
that have become obsolete soonerthan expected</p>
<p>In fact, although we tend todiscuss inventory models as though the
firm is buying a product from an outside supplier,most inventory models
apply equally well to production systems,</p>
<p>Mathematical inventory models can be classified along a number of
different dimensions: Mathematical inventory models can be classified
along a number of different dimensions: - Demand - Lead time - Review
type - Planning horizon - Stockout type - Ensuring good service - Fixed
cost - Perishability</p>
<p>Like all mathematical models, inventory models must balance two
competing factors—realism and tractability</p>
<p>The goal of most inventory models is to minimize the cost (or
maximize the profit) of theinventory system. Four types of costs: -
Holding cost - Fixed cost - Purchase cost - Stockout cost</p>
<p>Stockout cost. This is the cost of not having sufficient inventory to
meet demand, alsocalled the penalty cost or stockout penalty</p>
<p>There are several measures that we use to assess the amount of
inventory in the system atany given time. There are several measures
that we use to assess the amount of inventory in the system at any given
time. - On-hand inventory (OH) refers to the number of units that are
actually available at the stocking location. - Backorders (BO) represent
demands that have occurred but have not been satisfied. Generally, it’s
not possible for the on-hand inventory and the backorders to be positive
at the same time - The inventory level (IL) is equal to the on-hand
inventory minus backorders - inventory position (IP), which equals the
inventory level plus items on order</p>
<p>the economic order quantity (EOQ) model, perhaps the oldest and
best-known mathematical inventory model (Section 3.2), and some of its
extensions; and thena periodic-review model</p>
<p>The models discussed in this chapter are sometimes known as economic
lot size problems. ## 3.2 Continuous Review: The Economic Order Quantity
Problem ### 3.2.1 Problem Statement</p>
<p>The economic order quantity (EOQ) problem is one of the oldest and
most fundamentalinventory models; it was first introduced by Harris
(1913). The goal is to determine theoptimal amount to order each time an
order is placed to minimize the average cost per year.</p>
<p>Any optimal solution for the EOQ model has two important properties:
Any optimal solution for the EOQ model has two important properties: 1.
Zero-inventory ordering (ZIO) property; 2. Constant order sizes.</p>

class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> by the equation: <span
class="math display">\[
T = \frac{Q}{\lambda}
\]</span></p>
<h3 id="cost-function">3.2.2 Cost Function</h3>
<p>We want to find the optimal Q to minimize the average annual
cost.</p>
<p>he key trade-off is between fixed cost and holdingcost: If we use a
large <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span>, we’ll place fewer orders
and hold more inventory (small fixedcost but large holding cost),
whereas if we use a small <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span>, we’ll
place more orders and holdless inventory (large fixed cost but small
holding cost). - <em>Order cost</em> per year <span
class="math display">\[
\frac{K}{T} = \frac{K\lambda}{Q}
\]</span> - Average Annual <em>Holding Cost</em> <span
class="math display">\[
\frac{hQ}{2}
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> is a fixed cost
per order, <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> is an inventory
holding cost per unit per year. <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span>
is purchase cost per unit ordered.</p>
<p>The average inventory level in a cycle is <span
class="math inline">\(Q/2\)</span>, so the average amount ofinventory
per year is <span class="math inline">\(Q/2\)</span> ·1 year = <span
class="math inline">\(Q/2\)</span> - <em>Total Cost</em> <span
class="math display">\[
g(Q) = \frac{K\lambda}{Q} + \frac{hQ}{2}
\]</span></p>
<h3 id="optimal-solution">3.2.3 Optimal Solution</h3>
<p>The optimal <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> can be obtained by
taking the derivative of <span class="math inline">\(g(Q)\)</span> and
setting it to <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
\frac{d g(Q)}{d Q}=-\frac{K \lambda}{Q^2}+\frac{h}{2} &amp; =0 \\
\Longrightarrow Q^2 &amp; =\frac{2 K \lambda}{h} \\
\Longrightarrow Q^* &amp; =\sqrt{\frac{2 K \lambda}{h}}
\end{aligned}
\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(Q^*\)</span> is the <em>economic order
quantity</em>. Then, the optimal total cost is <span
class="math inline">\(g(Q^*)\)</span> is: <span class="math display">\[
g(Q^*) = \sqrt{2K\lambda h}
\]</span> Another way to see that the fixed and holding costs are equal
in the optimal solution isto note that the product of the two terms in
(3.3) i</p>
<p>The ability to express g(Q∗) in closed form allows us to learn about
structuralproperties of the EOQ and related models, such as the
power-of-two policies discussed inSection 3.3, as well as to embed the
EOQ into other, richer models, such as the locationmodel with risk
pooling (LMRP) in Section 12.2</p>
<p>make some statements about how the solution changes asthe parameters
change:</p>
<p>Remember that the EOQ only reflects costs, not revenues; the
increased cost of large λwould be outweighed by the increased revenue
### 3.2.4 Sensitivity Analysis</p>
<p>Suppose the firm did not want to order <span
class="math inline">\(Q^∗\)</span> exactly. For example, it might need
to order in multiples of <span class="math inline">\(10 (Q =
10n)\)</span>, or it might want to order every month (<span
class="math inline">\(T = 1/12\)</span>). <strong>Theorem</strong>:
Suppose <span class="math inline">\(Q^*\)</span> is the <em>optimal
order quantity</em> in the EOQ model, then for any <span
class="math inline">\(Q&gt;0\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[
\frac{g(Q)}{g(Q^*)} = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{Q^*}{Q} +
\frac{Q}{Q^*}\right)
\]</span></p>
<p>Theorem 3.2 ignores the per-unit cost c. If we include the annual
cost cλin the numeratorand denominator of (3.8), then the percentage
increase in cost would be even smaller ### 3.2.5 Order Lead Times</p>
<p>What if the lead time was positive—say, L years? Theoptimal solution
doesn’t change—we just place our order L years before it’s needed.</p>
<p>It’s generally more convenient to express this in terms ofthe reorder
point (<span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>). So how do we compute
<span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>? It should be equal to the amount
of product demanded during the lead time, or <span
class="math display">\[
r = \lambda L
\]</span> ## 3.3 Power-of-two Policies</p>
<p>In this section, we discusspower-of-two policies, in which the order
interval is required to be a power-of-two multipleof some base
period.</p>
<p>hen the power-of-two restriction says that orders can beplaced every
1 day, or every 2 days, or every 4 days, or every 8 days, and so on</p>
<p>Wealready know that the EOQ model is relatively insensitive to
deviations from the optimalsolution from Theorem 3.2. Our goal is to
determine exactly how much more expensive apower-of-two policy is than
the optimal policy</p>
<p>he problem of finding optimalorder intervals in this setting is one
version of a problem known as the one warehouse,multiretailer (OWMR)
problem ### 3.3.2 Error Bound</p>
<p>Theorem 3.3</p>
<p><strong>Theorem 3.3</strong> If <span class="math inline">\(\hat
T\)</span> is the optimal power-of-two order interval and <span
class="math inline">\(T^∗\)</span> is the optimal (not necessarily
power-of-two) order interval, then <span class="math display">\[
\frac{f(\hat T)}{f(T^*)} \le \frac{3}{2\sqrt2} \approx 1.06
\]</span> n other words, the cost of the optimal power-of-two policy is
no more than 6% greaterthan the cost of the optimal (non-power-of-two)
policy Hints for proof: the optimal power-of-two order interval <span
class="math inline">\(\hat T\)</span> must be in the interval <span
class="math inline">\(\left[ \frac{1}{\sqrt 2} T^*, \sqrt 2 T^*
\right]\)</span>. Since we don't know precisely where <span
class="math inline">\(\hat T\)</span> falls in the range, so it is only
a <em>worst-case</em> bound that occurs on the endpoints of the
range.</p>
<h2 id="the-eoq-with-quantity-discounts">3.4 The EOQ With Quantity
Discounts</h2>
<p>It is common for suppliers to offer discounts based on the quantity
ordered</p>
<p>The specificstructure for the discounts can take many forms, but two
types are most common: all-unitsdiscounts and incremental discount ###
3.4.1 All-Units Discounts</p>
<p>We can no longer ignore the purchase cost as we did in (3.3). In
fact, not only do we needto include the purchase cost itself, but we
must also account for the fact that the holdingcost typically depends on
the purchase cost</p>
<p>Suppose we knew that the optimal order quantity lies in region <span
class="math inline">\(j\)</span>. Then we would simplyneed to find the
<span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> that minimizes the EOQ cost
function for region <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>: <span
class="math display">\[
g_j(Q) = c_j \lambda + \frac{K\lambda}{Q} + \frac{ic_jQ}{2}
\]</span> Its minimizer is given by: <span class="math display">\[
Q_j^* = \sqrt{ \frac{2K\lambda}{ic_j}}
\]</span> ### 3.4.2 Incremental Discounts</p>
<p>We now turn our attention to incremental discounts. The total cost
function for region <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> is given by
<span class="math display">\[
g_j(Q) = \frac{c(Q)}{Q} \lambda + \frac{K\lambda}{Q} + \frac{i
\frac{c(Q)}{Q}Q}{2}
\]</span> where <span class="math display">\[
c(Q) = \sum\limits_{i=0}^{j} c_i (b_{i+1} - b_i) + c_j (Q -b_j)
\]</span> Then, we can rewrite <span
class="math inline">\(g_j(Q)\)</span> as <span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
g_j(Q)= &amp; \frac{1}{Q}\left[\sum_{i=0}^{j-1}
c_i\left(b_{i+1}-b_i\right)-c_j b_j\right] \lambda+c_j \lambda+\frac{K
\lambda}{Q} \\
&amp; +\frac{i}{2}\left[\sum_{i=0}^{j-1} c_i\left(b_{i+1}-b_i\right)-c_j
b_j\right]+\frac{i c_j Q}{2} \\
= &amp; c_j \lambda+\frac{i \bar{c}_j}{2}+\frac{\left(K+\bar{c}_j\right)
\lambda}{Q}+\frac{i c_j Q}{2}
\end{aligned}
\]</span> where <span class="math display">\[
\bar c_j = \sum_{i=0}^{j-1} c_i\left(b_{i+1}-b_i\right)-c_j b_j
\]</span> so the minimizer is given by <span class="math display">\[
Q^* = \sqrt{ \frac{2(K + \bar c_j)\lambda}{i c_j}}
\]</span> with cost <span class="math display">\[
g_j(Q^*) = c_j \lambda +  \frac{i \bar c_j}{2} + \sqrt{ 2(K + \bar
c_j)\lambda i c_j}
\]</span> ### 3.4.3 Modified All-Units Discounts</p>
<p>All-units discounts are somewhat problematic because, for order
quantities Q just to theleft of breakpoint j, it is cheaper to order bj
than to order Q</p>
<p>This structure is sometimes known as the modified all-units discount
structure.</p>
<p>A special case of the modified all-units discount structure is the
carload discount struc-ture, in which the bj are equally spaced and cj
is the same for all j.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, modified all-units discount structures are much more
difficult to analyzethan the discount structures discussed above. ## 3.5
The EOQ with Planned Backorders</p>
<p>In this section, we discuss avariant of the EOQ problem in which
backorders are allowed. Let <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> be
the backorder penalty per item per year, and let <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> be the fraction of demand that is
backordered. Both <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> are decision variables. The holding
cost is charged based on on-hand inventory; the average on-hand
inventory is given by: <span class="math display">\[
\frac{1}{2} Q(1-x) \cdot\frac{(1-x)T}{T} = \frac{Q(1-x)^2}{2}
\]</span> Similarly, the average backorder level is: <span
class="math display">\[
\frac{Qx^2}{2}
\]</span> There, the total average cost per year in the EOQB is given
by: <span class="math display">\[
g(Q,x) = \frac{hQ(1-x)^2}{2} + \frac{pQx^2}{2} + \frac{K\lambda}{Q}
\]</span> Therefore, to minimize it, we need to take partialderivatives
with respect to both variables and set them equal to 0. <span
class="math display">\[
\begin{align}
\frac{\partial g}{\partial x} &amp;=-h Q(1-x)+p Q x=0 \\
\frac{\partial g}{\partial Q} &amp;=\frac{h(1-x)^2}{2}+\frac{p
x^2}{2}-\frac{K \lambda}{Q^2}=0
\end{align}
\]</span> for the first equation, we have: <span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
-h Q(1-x)+p Q x &amp; =0 \\
\Longleftrightarrow h(1-x) &amp; =p x \\
\Longleftrightarrow x^* &amp; =\frac{h}{h+p}
\end{aligned}
\]</span> Then, plug <span class="math inline">\(x^*\)</span>, we have
<span class="math display">\[
\begin{align*}
Q^* &amp;= \sqrt{\frac{2K\lambda}{h(1-x)^2 + px^2}} \\
Q^* &amp;= \sqrt{\frac{2K\lambda (p+h)}{hp}}
\end{align*}
\]</span> Then <span class="math display">\[
g(Q^*, x^*) = \sqrt{\frac{2K\lambda hp}{h+p}}
\]</span> How do the optimal solution and cost in Theorem 3.5 compare to
the analogous quantitiesfrom the EOQ model? As <span
class="math inline">\(p\to \infty\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(Q^∗\)</span> approaches the optimal EOQ order
quantity, <span class="math inline">\(x^∗\)</span> approaches 0, and the
optimal cost approaches the EOQ optimal cost.</p>
<p>As we continue to increase the number of backorders, the marginal
savingsin holding cost decreases and the marginal increase in backorder
cost increases ## 3.6 The Economic Production Quantity Model</p>
<p>In a manufacturing environment, the amount of time required to
produce a batch of itemsusually depends on how large the batch
is—producing more items requires more time.</p>
<p>n other words,the EOQ assumes that the production rate is infinite—an
arbitrary number of items can beproduced in a fixed amount of time</p>
<p>Let ρ = λ/μ be the utilization ratio, which indicates the portion of
time the system isactive. Q is now interpreted as a production batch
size rather than an order quantity.</p>
<p>The fixed cost per year is still Kλ/Q, as in the EOQ model, since T =
Q/λ. <img

<ul>
<li>The order interval <span class="math display">\[
T = \frac{Q}{\lambda}
\]</span></li>
<li>Active interval <span class="math display">\[
\frac{Q}{\mu} = \rho T
\]</span></li>
<li>Maximum inventory level <span class="math display">\[
\rho T (\mu - \lambda) = (1-\rho) Q
\]</span></li>
<li>Fixed cost per year: <span class="math inline">\(\frac{K
\lambda}{Q}\)</span></li>
<li>Average inventory level: <span
class="math inline">\(\frac{(1-\rho)Q}{2}\)</span></li>
<li>Average annual holding cost: <span
class="math inline">\(\frac{h(1-\rho)Q}{2}\)</span></li>
<li>Total annual cost <span class="math display">\[
g(Q) = \frac{K\lambda}{Q} + \frac{h(1-\rho)Q}{2}
\]</span> We could find the Q that minimizes this cost function by
differentiating, as we did for theEOQ, ## 3.7 Periodic Review: The
Wagner-Whitin Model ### 3.7.1 Problem Statement</li>
</ul>
<p>We now shift our attention to a periodic-review model known as the
Wagner–Whitinmodel</p>
<p>he Wagner–Whitin modelassumes that the demand is deterministic, there
is a fixed cost to place an order, and stock-outs are not allowed</p>
<p>However, unlike the EOQ model, the Wagner–Whitin model allows the
demand to changeover time—to be different in each period</p>
<p>his model is sometimes referred to as thedynamic economic lot-sizing
(DEL) model or the uncapacitated lot-sizing (ULS) model.</p>
<p>We first formulate this model as a mixed-integer optimization problem
(MIP). We willthen discuss a dynamic programming (DP) algorithm for
solving it. ### 3.7.2 MIP Formulation</p>
<p>Constraints (3.34)are the inventory-balance constraints: They say
that the ending inventory in period t isequal to the starting inventory,
plus the new units ordered, minus the demand.</p>
<p>This problem can be interpreted as a simple supply chain network
design problem</p>
<p>It can be solved as an MIP, but it ismore common to solve it using DP
or as a shortest path problem, as we discuss in the nextsection ###
3.7.3 Dynamic Programming Algorithm</p>
<p>Theorem 3.7 Every optimal solution to the Wagner–Whitin model has the
ZIO property;that is, it is optimal to place orders only in time periods
in which the initial inventory iszero</p>
<p>Despite the efficiency of this algorithm, a number of heuristicshave
been introduced and are still popular in practice. These include
Silver–Meal, partperiod balancing, least unit cost, and other heuristics
# 4. Stochastic Inventory Models: Periodic Review</p>
<p>In this chapter and the next, we will consider inventory models in
which the demand isstochastic</p>
<p>A key concept in these chapters will be that of a policy. A policy is
a simple rulethat provides a solution to the inventory problem.</p>
<p>One could imagine severalpossible policies for this system. Here are
a few: 1. Every <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> periods, place an
order for <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> units.<br />
2. Whenever the inventory position falls to <span
class="math inline">\(s\)</span>, order <span
class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> units.<br />
3. Whenever the inventory position falls to <span
class="math inline">\(s\)</span>, place an order of sufficient size to
bring the inventory position to <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>.
4. Place an order whose size is equal to the first two digits of last
night’s lottery number. Then, wait a number of periods equal to the last
two digits of the lottery number before placing another order.</p>
<p>Forexample, policy 1 sounds reasonable, but only if we choose good
values for R and Q. When using policies, then, inventory optimization
really has two parts: Choosing theform of the optimal policy and
choosing the optimal parameters for that policy.</p>
<p>Similarly, for some problems,no one even knows the form of the
optimal policy, so we simply choose a policy that seemsplausible</p>
<p>Before continuing, we introduce two important concepts in stochastic
inventory theory:cycle stock and safety stock. - <em>Cycle stock</em>
(or working inventory) is the inventory that is intended to meet the
expected demand. - <em>Safety stock</em> is extra inventory that’s kept
on hand to buffer against uncertainty.</p>
<p>We’ll see later that the cycle stock depends on the mean of the
demand distribution, whilethe safety stock depends on the standard
deviation. ## 4.2 Demand Processes</p>
<p>In real life, customers tend to arrive at a retailer at random,
discrete points in time.</p>
<p>One way to model these demands is using a Poisson process, which
describesrandom arrivals to a system over time.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the normal distribution is used as an approximationfor the
Poisson distribution, in which case <span class="math inline">\(μ =
σ^2\)</span> since the Poisson variance equals itsmean. (This
approximation is especially accurate when the mean is large.</p>
<p>One drawback to using the normal distribution is that any normal
random variable willsometimes have negative realizations, even though
the demands that we aim to model arenonnegative</p>
<p>This suggeststhat the normal distribution is appropriate as a model
for the demand only if <span class="math inline">\(μ \gg σ\)</span> —
say,if <span class="math inline">\(μ &gt; 4σ\)</span>. ## 4.3 Periodic
Review With Zero Fixed Costs: Base-stock Policies</p>
<p>For the remainder of this chapter, we focus on periodic-review
models</p>
<p>We will model the time value of money by discounting future periods
using a discountfactor <span class="math inline">\(\gamma \in
(0,1]\)</span></p>
<p>For the single-period and finite-horizonproblems, our objective will
be to minimize the total expected discounted cost over thehorizon ###
4.3.1 Base-Stock Policies</p>
<p>A base-stock policy works as follows: In each time period, we observe
the current inventory position and then place an order whose size is
sufficient to bring the inventory position up to <span
class="math inline">\(S\)</span> ### 4.3.2 Single Period: The Newsvendor
Problem</p>
<p>Single-period models are most often applied to perishable products,
whichinclude (as you might expect) products such as eggs and flowers
that may spoil, but alsoproducts that lose their value after a certain
date,</p>
<p>This model is one of the most fundamental stochastic inventory
models, and many ofthe models discussed subsequently in this book use it
as a starting point.</p>
<p>If the newsvendor has unsold newspapers left at the endof the day, he
cannot sell them the next day, but he can sell them back to the
publisherfor $0.12 (called the salvage value).</p>
<p>The inventory carried by the newsvendor can be decomposed into two
components:cycle stock and safety stock</p>
<p>As previously noted, the newsvendor model applies to perishable
goods. In particular,it applies to goods that perish before the next
ordering opportunity.</p>
<p>The holding cost is the cost per unitof positive ending inventory,
while the stockout cost is the cost per unit of negative
endinginventory. The costs h and p are sometimes referred to as overage
and underage costs,</p>
<p>We will refer to the model discussed here as the implicit formulation
of the newsvendorproblem since the costs and revenues are not modeled
explicitly but instead are accountedfor in the holding and stockout
costs <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span></p>
<p>Our goal is to determine the base-stock level <span
class="math inline">\(S\)</span> to minimize the expected cost in
thesingle period.</p>
<p>These functions are known as the loss function and the complementary
loss function,3respectively. Let <span class="math inline">\(I(S,d) =
(S-d)^+\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(B(S, d) =
(d-S)^-\)</span> be the on-hand inventory and backorders, respectively.
At the end of period if the firm orders up to <span
class="math inline">\(S\)</span> and sees a demand of <span
class="math inline">\(d\)</span> units. The cost for an observed demand
od <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> is: <span
class="math display">\[
\begin{align}
g(S, d) &amp;= h I(S,d) + pB(S,d) \\
&amp; =h(S-d)^+ + p(d-S)^-
\end{align}
\]</span> Since the demand is <em>stochastic</em>, however, we must have
an expectation over <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>. Let <span
class="math inline">\(I(S) = \mathbb{E}[I(S,d)] =
\mathbb{E}[B(S,D)]\)</span> be the <em>expected</em> on-hand inventory
and backorders if the firm orders up to <span
class="math inline">\(S\)</span>. Then <span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
g(S) &amp; =h I(S)+p B(S) \\
&amp; =h \mathbb{E}\left[(S-D)^{+}\right]+p
\mathbb{E}\left[(D-S)^{+}\right] \\
&amp; =h \int_0^{\infty}(S-d)^{+} f(d) \operatorname d d+p
\int_0^{\infty}(d-S)^{+} f(d) \operatorname d d \\
&amp; =h \int_0^S(S-d) f(d) \operatorname d d+p \int_S^{\infty}(d-S)
f(d)\operatorname d d
\end{aligned}
\]</span> let <span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
n(x) &amp;=\mathbb{E}\left[(X-x)^{+}\right]=\int_x^{\infty}(y-x) f(y)
\operatorname d y \\
\bar{n}(x) &amp;=\mathbb{E}\left[(X-x)^{-}\right]=\int_0^x(x-y) f(y)
\operatorname d y
\end{aligned}
\]</span> Then: <span class="math display">\[
g(S) = h \bar{n}(S)+pn(S)
\]</span> Since <span class="math display">\[
\begin{align}
\bar{n}(S) &amp;=\int_0^S(S-d) f(d)\operatorname d d  \\
&amp;= \int_0^{+\infty}(S-d) f(d)\operatorname d d -
\int_S^{+\infty}(S-d) f(d)\operatorname d d \\
&amp;= S - \mu + \int_S^{+\infty}(d - S) f(d)\operatorname d d  \\
&amp;= S-\mu + n(S)
\end{align}
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> is the <em>mean
value</em> of <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span>. So we can
simplify the expression of <span class="math inline">\(g(S)\)</span>:
<span class="math display">\[
\begin{align}
g(S) &amp;= h [S-\mu +n(S)] +pn(S)  \\
&amp; = h(S-\mu) + (h+p) n(S)
\end{align}
\]</span> These functions are known as the <em>loss function</em> and
the <em>complementary loss function</em>, respectively. Here we can
calculate the derivatives of the above two equations according to the <a

<p>Sometimes, this is instead formulated as a profit maximization

<p>We can translate this to the implicit version of the problem by

this explicit formulation to the implicit version by determining the

<p>First consider what happens at the end of the time horizon.
Presumably, on-handunits and backorders must be treated differently now
that the horizon has ended than theywould be during the horizon ###
4.3.4 Infinite Horizon</p>
<p>This problem is sometimes referred to as the infinite-horizon
newsvendormodel.</p>
<p>An alternate objective is to minimizethe expected cost per period.
The former case is known as the discounted-cost criterion,while the
latter is known as the average-cost criterion Under the average cost
criterion, we assume <span class="math inline">\(\gamma = 1\)</span>.
The expected cost in a given period if we use back-stock level <span
class="math inline">\(S\)</span> is given by: <span
class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
g(S)  =h \int_0^S(S-d) f(d) \operatorname d d+p \int_S^{\infty}(d-S)
f(d)\operatorname d d = h\bar n(y) + p n(y)
\end{aligned}
\]</span> Now suppose <span class="math inline">\(\gamma &lt;
1\)</span>, consider the discounted-cost criterion. The optimal
base-stock level is the same in every period, and it is given by <span
class="math display">\[
S^* = F^{-1} \left( \frac{p-(1-\gamma)c}{h+p}\right)
\]</span> Then, if demand is normally distributed, then after modifying
to account for <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>, the results
would be <span class="math display">\[
S^* = \mu + \sigma \Phi^{-1}\left( \frac{p-(1-\gamma)c}{h+p}\right) =
\mu + z_\alpha \sigma
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\alpha = \left(
\frac{p-(1-\gamma)c}{h+p}\right)\)</span>.</p>
<p>In formulating (4.38), we glossed over two potentially problematic
issues. Two problematic issues: 1. Why didn’t we account for the
purchase cost <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span>, 2. Why didn’t we
account for the cost in future periods?</p>

<h3 id="ss-policies">4.4.1 <span class="math inline">\((s,S)\)</span>
Policies</h3>
<p>We now consider the more general case in which the fixed cost K may
be nonzero. If <span class="math inline">\(K \neq 0\)</span>, it may no
longer make sense to order in every period, since each order incurs a
cost.</p>
<p>Instead, the firm should order only when the inventory position
becomes sufficiently low.</p>
<p>Both <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(S\)</span> are constants, and <span
class="math inline">\(s ≤ S\)</span>.The quantity <span
class="math inline">\(s\)</span> is known as the reorder point and <span
class="math inline">\(S\)</span> as the order-up-to level</p>
<p>the optimality of (s,S) policies for multiperiod problems was not
provenuntil Scarf’s (1960) paper</p>
<p>We will discuss how to determine the optimal s and S for the
single-period, finite-horizon, and infinite-horizon cases separately</p>
<p>Actually, the single-period case is not nearly as useful for the
<span class="math inline">\(K &gt; 0\)</span> caseas it is for the <span
class="math inline">\(K = 0\)</span> case ### 4.4.2 Single Period</p>
<p>For given <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(S\)</span>, theordering rule is: If <span
class="math inline">\(x ≤ s\)</span>, order <span
class="math inline">\(S −x\)</span>; otherwise, order 0.
一旦订购（或不订购），就会产生持有和缺货成本，就像在零固定成本模型中一样，只是基础库存水平被
<span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>（如果我们订购）和 <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span>（如果我们不订购）取代。因此，该期间的总预期成本（作为
<span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> 和 <span
class="math inline">\(S\)</span> 的函数）由下式给出 <span
class="math display">\[
g(s, S) = \left\{\begin{array}{l} K + g(S), &amp;\text{if } x\leq s \\
g(x),  &amp; \text{if } x&gt; s
\end{array}\right.
\]</span></p>
<p>Optimizing <span class="math inline">\(g(s,S)\)</span> over s and
<span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> is actually quite easy (Karlin
1958b): We already knowfrom Theorem 4.1 that <span
class="math inline">\(F−1(p/(h + p))\)</span> minimizes <span
class="math inline">\(g(S)\)</span>, ### 4.4.3 Finite horizon</p>
<p>The finite-horizon model with nonzero fixed costs can be solved using
a straightforwardmodification of the DP model for the zero-fixed-cost
case from Section 4.3.3.</p>
<p>Now <span class="math inline">\(θ_t(x)\)</span> must account for the
fixed cost in period <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> (if any), as
well as the purchase cost and expected holding and stockout costs in
period <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, and the expected future
costs, as in the <span class="math inline">\(K = 0\)</span> model. In
particular Now <span class="math inline">\(θ_t(x)\)</span> must account
for the fixed cost in period <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> (if
any), as well as the purchase cost and expected holding and stockout
costs in period <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, and the expected
future costs, as in the <span class="math inline">\(K = 0\)</span>
model. In particular, <span class="math display">\[
\theta_t(x) = \min_{y \ge x}\left\{ K\delta (y-x) + c(y-x) + g(y) +
\gamma \mathbb E_D[\theta_{t+1} (y-D)]\right\}
\]</span> where <span class="math display">\[
\delta(z) = \left\{\begin{array}{l} 1, &amp;\text{if } z&gt;0 \\
0,  &amp; \text{otherwise}
\end{array}\right.
\]</span> <em>Note</em> : Since here fixed cost is not zero, so add the
fixed costs term <span class="math inline">\(K\delta (y-x)\)</span>. It
also consists of the general equation of periodic review, as follows

<p>However, just as before, we would rather have a simple policy to
follow, rather than having to specify <span
class="math inline">\(y_t(x)\)</span> for every <span
class="math inline">\(t\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span></p>
<p>In particular, for period <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>,
there are values <span class="math inline">\(S_t\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(s_t\)</span> such that for <span
class="math inline">\(x \leq s_t\)</span>, we have <span
class="math inline">\(y_t(x) = S_t\)</span>, and for <span
class="math inline">\(x &gt; s_t\)</span>, we have <span
class="math inline">\(y_t(x) = x\)</span>. In other words, these curves
each depict an <span class="math inline">\((s,S)\)</span> policy. ###
4.4.4 infinite Horizon</p>
<p>Recall that the infinite-horizon model with no fixed costs (Section
4.3.4) is as simple asthe single-period model (Section 4.3.2).</p>
<p>nfortunately, this is not true in the fixed-costcase. The
infinite-horizon model is more difficult than its single-period or
finite-horizoncounterparts</p>
<p>A renewal process is a random variable <span
class="math inline">\(N(t)\)</span> that counts the number of
“renewals”that have occurred by time <span
class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, where the amount of time between the
<span class="math inline">\((n −1)st\)</span> renewal and the nth
renewals is a random variable <span class="math inline">\(X_n\)</span>
## 4.5 Policy Optimility</p>
<p>Now that we know how to find the optimal <span
class="math inline">\(S\)</span> for a base-stock policy (Section 4.3)
and the optimal <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(S\)</span> for an <span
class="math inline">\((s,S)\)</span> policy (Section 4.4), we prove that
those policy types are in fact optimal for their respective problems</p>
<p>e are trying toshow that no other policy, of any type, using any
parameters, can outperform our chosenpolicy type (provided we choose the
optimal parameters) in the long run</p>
<p>We will first consider the zero-fixed-cost case, then the fixed-cost
case, in both casesconsidering single-period, finite-horizon, and
infinite-horizon cases separately</p>
<p>We continue to assumethat the cost and demand parameters are
stationary, but the results below still hold if thesevary from period to
period (deterministically). Recall the optimal cost in periods <span
class="math inline">\(t, \cdots, T\)</span> if we begin period <span
class="math inline">\(t\)</span> with an inventory level of <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, can be calculated recursively as:
<span class="math display">\[
\theta_t(x) = \min_{y \ge x}\left\{ K\delta (y-x) + c(y-x) + g(y) +
\gamma \mathbb E_D[\theta_{t+1} (y-D)]\right\}
\]</span></p>
<p>Our goal throughout this section will be to use the structure of
(4.81) toshow that the optimal actions follow the policies we have
conjectured are optimal ### 4.5.1 Zero Fixed Costs: Base-Stock
Policies</p>
<p>We first consider the case in which K = 0 and prove that—regardless
of the horizonlength—a base-stock policy is always optimal
<strong>Single Period</strong>:</p>
<p>we’ll consider the special case in which <span
class="math inline">\(T = 1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(K =
0\)</span>. We’ll also assume that the terminal cost function (i.e.,
<span class="math inline">\(\theta_{t+1} (x) = 0\)</span>, see <a
href="#4.3.3%20Finite%20Horizon">Section 4.3.3</a>) is equal to 0. Then,
the optimal cost reduces to: <span class="math display">\[
\theta(x) = \min_{y \ge x}\left\{c(y-x) + g(y) \right\}
\]</span> We cam rewrite <span class="math inline">\(\theta(x)\)</span>
as <span class="math display">\[
\theta(x) = \min_{y \ge x}\left\{H(y) -cx \right\}
\]</span> where <span class="math display">\[
H(y) = cy + g(y)
\]</span> Since we are calculating <span
class="math inline">\(θ(x)\)</span> for fixed <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, we see that the optimal decision can
be found by minimizing <span class="math inline">\(H(y)\)</span> over
<span class="math inline">\(y \ge x\)</span>, that is, starting at <span
class="math inline">\(y = x\)</span>, we want to minimize <span
class="math inline">\(H(y)\)</span> looking only “to the right” of <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span>.</p>
<p><em>If <span class="math inline">\(H(y)\)</span> is convex</em>, we
can have: - If <span class="math inline">\(x &lt; S\)</span>, then the
optimal strategy is to set <span class="math inline">\(y = S\)</span> -
if <span class="math inline">\(x \ge S\)</span>, the optimal strategy is
to do nothing, to set <span class="math inline">\(y = x\)</span>. In
other words, the optimal policy is a <em>base-stock policy</em>.</p>
<p>And H(y) is convex because g(y) is convex,so we have now sketched the
proof of the following theorem.</p>
<p>Theorem 4.10 A base-stock policy is optimal for the single-period
problem with no fixedcosts. <strong>Finite Horizon</strong>:</p>
<p>It was simple to prove that H(y) is convex, and therefore thata
base-stock policy is optimal, for the single-period problem</p>
<h3 id="nonzero-fixed-costs-s-s-policies">4.5.2 Nonzero Fixed Costs:
<span class="math inline">\((s, S)\)</span> Policies</h3>
<p>We now allow K 6= 0 and prove that an (s,S) policy is optimal. ## 4.6

<p>Throughout this chapter, we have assumed that unmet demands are
backordered.</p>
<p>we assume instead that they are lost. The distinction is only
important when T &gt; 1.(When T = 1, unmet demands can only be lost.)
### 4.6.1 Zero Lead Time</p>
<p>First consider the case in whichK = 0. In the finite-horizon model,
the DP recursion (4.36) changes only slightly <span
class="math display">\[
\theta_t(x) = \min_{y \ge x}\left\{c(y-x) + g(y) + \gamma \mathbb
E_D[\theta_{t+1} (y-D)]^+\right\}
\]</span> <em>Note</em>: the positive part of <span
class="math inline">\(y −D\)</span> to reflect the fact that the
inventory level cannot become <em>negative</em>.</p>
<p>A base-stock policy is still optimal for the infinite-horizon model.

Stochastic Inventory Models: Continuous Review ## 5.1 <span
class="math inline">\((r, Q)\)</span> Policies</p>
<p>In this chapter, we consider a setting similar to the economic order
quantity (EOQ) model(Section 3.2) but with stochastic demand.</p>
<p>The inventory position is monitored continuously, and orders may be
placed at any time. There is a deterministic lead time <span
class="math inline">\(L (\ge0)\)</span>. Unmet demands are
backordered</p>
<p>If the demand has a continuous distribution, then the inventory level
decreases smoothlybut randomly over time, with rate <span
class="math inline">\(λ\)</span>,</p>
<p><strong><span class="math inline">\((r, Q)\)</span>
Policy</strong>:</p>

<p>We’ll assume the firm follows an (r,Q) policy: When the inventory
position reaches acertain point (call it r), we place an order of size
Q. L years later, the order arrives</p>
<p>Note that the inventory level (solid line in Figure 5.1) and
inventoryposition (dashed line) differ from each other during lead times
but coincide otherwise. Differing from the EOQ model, which has a single
decision variable <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span>, the <span
class="math inline">\((r, Q)\)</span> Policy has two decision variables:
<span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> (the order quantity, sometimes
called the <em>batch size</em>) and <span
class="math inline">\(r\)</span> (the <em>reorder point</em>)</p>
<p>Our goal is to determine the optimal r and Q to minimize the expected
costper year.</p>
<p>since in either case theinventory position may fall strictly below
the reorder point before a replenishment order isplaced. ## 5.2 Exact
<span class="math inline">\((r, Q)\)</span> Problem With Continuous
Demand Distribution</p>
<p>we introduce an exact model for systems with continuous demand
distribu-tions. We first formulate the expected cost function and then
derive optimality conditionsfor it <strong>The usual costs</strong>: -
Fixed cost: <span class="math inline">\(K \ge 0\)</span> - Purchase
cost: <span class="math inline">\(c \ge 0\)</span> - Holding cost: <span
class="math inline">\(h &gt; 0\)</span> - Stockout cost: <span
class="math inline">\(p&gt;0\)</span> - <span
class="math inline">\(D\)</span>: the lead-time demand
(<em>运输期间</em>的需求), a random variable with mean <span
class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> and variance <span
class="math inline">\(\sigma^2\)</span>, pdf <span
class="math inline">\(f(d)\)</span> and cdf <span
class="math inline">\(F(d)\)</span></p>
<h3 id="expected-cost-function">5.2.1 Expected Cost Function</h3>
<p>Our first step is to derive an exact expression for the expected cost
as a function of r and Q. First, we place orders, on average every <span
class="math inline">\(Q/\lambda\)</span> years. There the expected fixed
cost is given by <span class="math inline">\(K\lambda/Q\)</span>.</p>
<p>If the inventory position at time <span
class="math inline">\(t\)</span> is given by <span
class="math inline">\(IP(t)\)</span>, then the inventory level at time
<span class="math inline">\(t +L\)</span> is given by: <span
class="math display">\[
IL(t+L) = IP(t) - (t, t+L]
\]</span> As in the periodic-review case, we can drop the time indices
in steady state and write: <span class="math display">\[
IL = IP -D
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> is the lead-time
demand.</p>
<p>Once we determine the distribution of IP, the (unconditional)
expected inventory costthen follows from the law of total expectation.
Let <span class="math inline">\(\bar g(x)\)</span> be the rate at which
the inventory cost accrues when <span class="math inline">\(IL =
x\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[
\bar g (x) = hx^+ + px^-
\]</span> <em>Note</em>: <span class="math inline">\(g(\cdot)\)</span>
is a rate because the inventory level is changing continuously over
time, given in units of money per year. Then the expected inventory cost
per year is: <span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
\mathbb{E}[\text { inventory cost }] &amp; =\mathbb{E}_{I L}[\bar{g}(I
L)] \\
&amp; =\mathbb{E}_{I P}\left[\mathbb{E}_{I L \mid I P}[\bar{g}(I
L)]\right] \\
&amp; =\mathbb{E}_{I P}\left[\mathbb{E}_D[\bar{g}(I P-D)]\right] \\
&amp; =\mathbb{E}_{I P}[g(I P)]
\end{aligned}
\]</span> where <span class="math display">\[
g(y) = h \mathbb{E}[(y-D)^+] + p \mathbb{E}[(D-y)^+]
\]</span> <span class="math inline">\(g(y)\)</span> is the rate at which
the expected inventory cost accrues at time <span
class="math inline">\(t + L\)</span> when the inventory position at time
<span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> equals <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span>.</p>
<p>It remains to determine the distribution of <span
class="math inline">\(IP\)</span>. By the definition of an <span
class="math inline">\((r,Q)\)</span> policy, we know that <span
class="math inline">\(IP\)</span> takes values only in <span
class="math inline">\([r,r + Q]\)</span>.</p>
<p>在一些简单例子中，<span class="math inline">\(IP\)</span>
可以是简单的分布，如均匀分布。因此，我们可以用如下积分形式计算
<em>期望损失</em>： <span class="math display">\[
\mathbb {E} [\text{inventory cost}] = \frac{1}{Q} \int_r^{r+Q}g(y)
\operatorname d y
\]</span> Combining the expected inventory cost and the expected fixed
cost <span class="math inline">\(K\lambda/Q\)</span>, we have the
expected total cost per year: <span class="math display">\[
g(r, Q) = \frac{K\lambda + \int_r^{r+Q}g(y) \operatorname d y}{Q}
\]</span> Lemma 5.1 g(r,Q) is jointly convex in r and Q.</p>
<p>In what follows, we use the expected cost expression (5.7) to derive
optimality conditionsfor <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> by first fixing <span
class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> and finding the optimal corresponding
<span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>, and then optimizingover <span
class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> ### 5.2.2 Optimality Conditions</p>
<p>Lemma 5.2 For any <span class="math inline">\(Q &gt; 0, r =
r(Q)\)</span> if and only if <strong>Lemma</strong> For any <span
class="math inline">\(Q &gt; 0, r = r(Q)\)</span> if and only if <span
class="math display">\[
g(r) = g(r+Q)
\]</span> The motivation behind this result is that, during one
replenishment cycle, we need topass through all of the inventory
positions in [r,r + Q] <strong>Theorem</strong> <span
class="math inline">\((r,Q)\)</span> minimize <span
class="math inline">\(g(r,Q)\)</span> if and only if: <span
class="math display">\[
g(r, Q) = g(r +Q) = g(r)
\]</span> ## 5.3 Approximations for <span class="math inline">\((r,
Q)\)</span> Problem With Continuous Distribution ### 5.3.1
Expected-Inventory-Level Approximation</p>
<p>The first approximation we discuss is probably the best known and
most widely coveredapproximation to find r and Q.</p>
<p>We call this the expected-inventory-level (EIL) approximation,for
reasons that will become clear shortly</p>
<p>The approach relies on the following two simplifying assumptions to
make the modeltractable: Two assumptions: 1. Simplifying Assumption 1
(SA1): Incur holding costs at a rate of <span class="math inline">\(h
\cdot IL\)</span> per year, where <span
class="math inline">\(IL\)</span> is the inventory level, whether <span
class="math inline">\(IL\)</span> is positive or negative. 2.
Simplifying Assumption 2 (SA2): The stockout cost is charged once per
unit of unmet demand, not per year.</p>

</figure>
<p>The costs: - The expected on-hand inventory when the order arrives:
<span class="math display">\[
    s = r -\lambda L
\]</span> - The average inventory level: <span class="math display">\[
    s+\frac{Q}{2} = r -\lambda L +\frac{Q}{2}
  \]</span> 1. By <em>SA1</em>, the <em>expected holding cost</em> per
year is: <span class="math display">\[
h\left( r -\lambda L +\frac{Q}{2}\right)
\]</span> <em>Note</em>: this expression is only approximate, since that
we are calculating the expected holding cost as <span
class="math inline">\(h \cdot \mathbb{E}[IL]^+\)</span> (provided that
<span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{E}[IL]&gt;0\)</span>).</p>
<p>That is why we refer to this as the “expected-inventory-level”
approximation. The problem is more difficult without SA1 because of the
nonlinearity introduced by the <span
class="math inline">\([·]^+\)</span> operator. 2. <em>Fixed cost</em> :
<span class="math inline">\(\frac{K\lambda}{Q}\)</span> - <em>Stockout
cost</em> : <span class="math display">\[
\mathbb{E}[(D-r)^+] = \int_r^\infty (d-r) f(d)\operatorname dd = n(r)
\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(n(r)\)</span> is the loss function
for the lead-time demand distribution The expected number of stockout
per year is <span class="math display">\[
\frac{n(r)}{\mathbb{E}[T]} = \frac{\lambda n(r)}{Q}
\]</span> 3. then by <em>SA2</em>, the <em>expected stockout cost</em>
per year is simply: <span class="math display">\[
\frac{p \lambda n(r)}{Q}
\]</span></p>
<p>Note that we are assuming that r &gt; 0, which is a reasonable
assumption in practice <strong>The total cost</strong> per year: <span
class="math display">\[
g(r, Q) = h\left( r -\lambda L +\frac{Q}{2}\right) + \frac{K\lambda}{Q}
+ \frac{p \lambda n(r)}{Q}
\]</span> <strong>Solution</strong>: - For <span
class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> : $$ <span
class="math display">\[\begin{align}
    \frac{\partial g}{\partial Q} =\frac{h}{2}-\frac{K
\lambda}{Q^2}-\frac{p \lambda n(r)}{Q^2} &amp; =0 \\
    \Longleftrightarrow \quad \frac{1}{Q^2}[K \lambda+p \lambda
n(r)]=\frac{h}{2} \\
    \Longleftrightarrow\quad Q^2=\frac{2[K \lambda+p \lambda n(r)]}{h}
\\
    Q=\sqrt{\frac{2 \lambda[K+p n(r)]}{h}} \\
    
    \end{align}\]</span> $$ - For <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>
:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align}
\frac{\partial g}{\partial r}=h+\frac{p \lambda n^{\prime}(r)}{Q}=0 \\
\Longleftrightarrow \quad h+\frac{p \lambda(F(r)-1)}{Q}=0 \\
r=F^{-1}\left(1-\frac{Q h}{p \lambda}\right)
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>Now we have two equations with two unknowns, but these equations
cannot be solvedin closed form.</p>
<p>The approach given in Algorithm 5.1 first sets Q equal to the EOQ
quantity,i.e., ignoring the demand randomness.</p>
<p>One major limitation of (r,Q) policies as formulated aboveis that p
is very hard to estimate ### 5.3.2 EOQB Approximation</p>
<p>There are important connections between the EOQ problem with planned
backorders ### 5.3.3 EOQ + SS Approximation</p>
<p>Another common approximation for r and Q is to convert the
inventory-cost parametersinto a service level and then to use the
approach described in Section 5.3.1.3 for type-1service level
constraints ## 5.4 Exact <span class="math inline">\((r, Q)\)</span>
Problem With Continuous Distribution: Properties of Optimal <span
class="math inline">\(r\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(Q\)</span></p>
<p>We now return to the exact model from Section 5.2. We have two main
goals in thissection 1. We will analyze the properties of optimal
solutions (and their costs) for <span class="math inline">\((r,
Q)\)</span> policies, by deriving <em>optimality conditions</em> for
<span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> and then providing <em>properties</em>
of the resulting optimal solutions. 2. We will compare <span
class="math inline">\((r,Q)\)</span> policies to the EOQB model and
prove.</p>
<p>if the EOQB model is used as a heuristic for optimizing r and Q,
asdiscussed in Section 5.3.2, the resulting error has a fixed bound. Let
<span class="math inline">\(G(Q)\)</span> equal the expected cost per
year as a function of <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span>, assuming
<span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> is set optimally for that <span
class="math inline">\(Q\)</span>, <span class="math display">\[
G(Q) = g(r(Q), Q)
\]</span> Let <span class="math inline">\(H(Q)\)</span> be the value of
<span class="math inline">\(g(y)\)</span> at <span
class="math inline">\(y=r(Q)\)</span>, or <span
class="math inline">\(r(Q)+Q\)</span> <span class="math display">\[
H(Q) = g(r(Q)) = g(r(Q)+Q)
\]</span> Then we have <span class="math display">\[
G(Q) = \frac{K\lambda + \int_0^{Q}H(y) \operatorname d y}{Q}
\]</span></p>
<h1 id="multi-echelon-inventory-models">6. Multi-echelon Inventory
Models</h1>
<p>we study inventory optimization models for multiechelon (or
multistage)systems with shipments made among the stages ## 6.1
Introduction There are two common ways to interpret the stages or nodes
in the multiechelon system: 1. Stages represent locations in a supply
chain network, and links among the stages represent physical shipments
of goods. 2. Stages represent processes that the product must undergo
during manufacturing, assembly, and/or distribution.</p>
<p>the stages in Figure 6.1(a)may represent the following physical
locations: a supplier in China, a factory inCalifornia, a warehouse in
Chicago, and a retailer in Detroit (respectively).</p>
<p>For example, the stages in Figure 6.1(a) may represent thefollowing
processes: manufacturing, assembly, testing, and packaging. These
fourfunctions may take place in four different locations or all within
the same building # 8. Facility Location Models ## 8.1 Introduction</p>
<p>One of the major strategic decisions faced by firms is the number and
locations of factories,warehouses, retailers, or other physical
facilities</p>
<p>The key trade-off in most facility locationproblems is between the
facility cost and customer service. - More facilities</p>
<p>If we open a lot of facilities(Figure 8.1(a)), we incur high facility
costs (to build and maintain them), but we can providegood service since
most customers are close to a facility. <img
src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/YangSuoly/Images/Prelim/202412011140221.png"
alt="Pasted image 20241009165803" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Few facilities</li>
</ul>
<p>if we openfew facilities (Figure 8.1(b)), we reduce our facility
costs but must travel farther to reachour customers (or they to reach
us). <img
src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/YangSuoly/Images/Prelim/202412011140222.png"
alt="Pasted image 20241009165826" /></p>
<p>Most (but not all) location problems make two related sets of
decisions: (1) where tolocate, and (2) which customers are assigned or
allocated to which facilities.</p>
<p>Therefore,facility location problems are also sometimes known as
location–allocation problems</p>
<p>These differ in terms of how they model facility costs (for example,
some include the costsexplicitly, while others impose a constraint on
the number of facilities to be opened) andhow they model customer
service (for example, some include a transportation cost, whileothers
require all or most facilities to be covered—that is, served by a
facility that is withinsome specified distance).</p>
<p>In addition to supply chain facilities such as plants and warehouses,
location modelshave been applied to public sector facilities</p>
<p>In addition, many operations research problems can be formulatedas
facility location problems or have subproblems that resemble them</p>
<p>In this chapter, we will begin by discussing a classical facility
location model, theuncapacitated fixed-charge location problem
(UFLP)</p>
<p>we discuss cover-ing models (including the p-center, set covering,
and maximal covering problems) ## 8.2 The Uncapacitated fixed-charge
Location Problem ### 8.2.1 Problem Statement</p>
<p>The uncapacitated fixed-charge location problem (UFLP) chooses
facility locations inorder to minimize the total cost of building the
facilities and transporting goods fromfacilities to customers.</p>
<p>Sometimes it’s also useful to think of an upstream echelon,again with
fixed location(s), that serves the DCs. - Fixed cost</p>
<p>Each potential DC location has a fixed cost that represents building
(or leasing) thefacility; - Transportation cost</p>
<p>transportation cost per unit of product shipped from a DC to each
customer. - <em>Objective</em></p>
<p>The problem is to choosefacility locations to minimize the fixed cost
of building facilities plus the transportationcost to transport product
from DCs to customers, subject to constraints requiring everycustomer to
be served by some open DC</p>
<p>As noted above, the key trade-off in the UFLP is between fixed and
transportation costs ### 8.2.2 Formulation</p>
<p>Define the following notations:</p>
<p><strong>Sets</strong>: - <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> : set
of customers - <span class="math inline">\(J\)</span>: set of potential
facility locations <strong>Parameters</strong> - <span
class="math inline">\(h_i\)</span> : annual demand of customer <span
class="math inline">\(i \in I\)</span> - <span
class="math inline">\(c_{ij}\)</span> : cost to transport one unit of
demand from facility <span class="math inline">\(j \in J\)</span> to
customer <span class="math inline">\(i \in I\)</span> - <span
class="math inline">\(f_j\)</span> : fixed annual cost to open a
facility at site <span class="math inline">\(j \in J\)</span>
<strong>Decision Variables</strong> - <span
class="math inline">\(x_j\)</span> : 1 if facility <span
class="math inline">\(j\)</span> is opened, 0 otherwise - <span
class="math inline">\(y_{ij}\)</span> : the fraction of customer <span
class="math inline">\(i\)</span>'s demand that is served by facility
<span class="math inline">\(j\)</span></p>
<p><em>Note</em> : The transportation costs <span
class="math inline">\(c_{ij}\)</span> might be of the form <span
class="math inline">\(k \times\)</span> distance for some constant <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span> (if the shipping company charges k per
mile per unit) or more arbitrary (for example, based on airline ticket
prices, which are not linearly related to distance)</p>
<p>In the former case,distances may be computed in a number of ways:
Distances: - <em>Euclidean distance</em>: - <em>Manhattan</em> or
<em>rectilinear metric</em> - <em>Great circle</em> -
<em>Highway/network</em> - <em>Matrix</em></p>
<p>In general, we won’t be concerned with how transportation costs are
computed—we’ll assume they are given to us already as the parameters
<span class="math inline">\(c_{ij}\)</span> The UFLP is formulated as
follows: <span class="math display">\[
\min \quad \sum\limits_{j\in J} f_j x_j + \sum\limits_{i\in I}
\sum\limits_{j\in J} h_i c_{ij} y_{ij}
\]</span> subject to <span class="math display">\[
\begin{align}
\sum\limits_{j \in J}y_{ij} &amp;=1  &amp;\forall i \in I \\
y_{ij} &amp;\leq x_j &amp;\forall i \in I, \forall j \in J \\
x_j &amp;\in\{0, 1\} &amp;\forall j \in J \\
y_{ij} &amp;\ge 0  &amp; \forall i \in I, \forall j \in J
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p><em>Note</em> : in the discussion that follows, we’ll use <span
class="math inline">\(z^∗\)</span> to denote the optimal objective value
of (UFLP).</p>
<p>The objective function (8.3) computes the total (fixed plus
transportation) cost.</p>
<p>In fact, it is always optimalto assign each customer solely to its
nearest open facility.</p>
<p>It is important to understand that theIPs have the same optimal
objective value, but the LPs have different values—one providesa weaker
LP bound than the other.</p>
<p>Some of the earliest exact algorithms involve simply solving the IP
usingbranch-and-bound</p>
<p>Therefore, a number of other optimal approaches were developed. Two
ofthese—Lagrangian relaxation and a dual-ascent method called DUALOC—are
discussedin Sections 8.2.3 and 8.2.4, respectivel ### 8.2.3 Lagrangian
Relation</p>
<p>One of the methods that has proven to be most effective forthe UFLP
and other location problems is Lagrangian relaxation, a standard
technique forinteger programming</p>
<p>Lagrangian relaxation is to remove a set of constraints to create a
problem that’seasier to solve than the original.</p>
<p>by adding a term that penalizes solutions for violating
theconstraints</p>
<p>When the upper and lower bounds are close (say, within1%), we know
that the feasible solution we have found is close to optima</p>
<p>We relax constraints (8.4), removing them from the problem andadding
a penalty term to the objective function: <span class="math display">\[
\sum\limits_{j \in J} \lambda_i (1-y_{ij})
\]</span> The <span class="math inline">\(\lambda_i\)</span> are called
<em>Lagrange multipliers</em>.</p>
<p>For now, assume λ is fixed. Relaxing constraints (8.4) gives us the
following problem,known as the Lagrangian subproblem: The <em>Lagrangian

<p>It turns out that the problem is quite easy to solveby inspection—we
don’t need to use an IP solver or any sort of complicated algorithm.</p>
<p>The point of Lagrangian relaxation is not to generate feasible
solutions, since the solutionsto (UFLP-LRλ) will generally be infeasible
for (UFLP). Instead, the point is to generategood (i.e., high) lower
bounds in order to prove that a feasible solution we’ve foundsome other
way is good. ### 8.2.4 The DUALOC Algorithm</p>
<h2 id="other-minisum-models">8.3 Other Minisum Models</h2>
<p>The UFLP is an example of a minisum location problem. Minisum models
are so calledbecause their objective is to minimize a sum of the costs
or distances between customers andtheir assigned facilities</p>
<p>covering location problems are more concerned with the maximum
distance, with the goalof ensuring that most or all customers are
located close to their assigned facilities</p>
<p>minisum models are more commonlyapplied in the private sector, in
which profits and costs are the dominant concerns, andcovering models
are most commonly applied in the public sector, in which service,
fairness,and equity are more important ### 8.3.1 The Capacitated
Fixed-Charge Location Problem</p>
<p>The UFLP can be easilymodified to account for capacity restrictions;
the resulting problem (not surprisingly) iscalled the capacitated
fixed-charge location problem, or CFLP. ## 8.4 Covering Models</p>
<p>fire departments should have the objective of arriving to afire
within 4 minutes of receiving a call</p>
<p>ince the optimal solutions to those problems may assign some
customers tovery distant facilities if it is cost effective to do so</p>
<p>Instead, we need to use the notion ofcoverage, which indicates
whether a given customer is within a prespecified distance, orcoverage
radius, of an open facility.</p>
<p>we discuss three seminal facility location models that use coverage
todetermine the quality of the solution 1. Set covering location problem
(SCLP): locates the minimum number of facilities to cover every demand
node 2. <em>maximal covering location problem</em> (MCLP): covers as
many demands as possible while locating a fixed number of facilities. 3.
<em>p-center problem</em>: locates a fixed number of facilities to
minimize the maximum distance from a demand node to its nearest open
facility.</p>
<h3 id="the-set-covering-location-problem">8.4.1 The Set Covering
Location Problem</h3>
<p>In the set covering location problem (SCLP), we are required to cover
every demand node;the objective is to do so with the fewest possible
number of facilities. <strong>Parameters</strong>: - <span
class="math inline">\(a_{ij}=1\)</span> : if facility <span
class="math inline">\(j\in J\)</span> can cover customer <span
class="math inline">\(i\in I\)</span> (if it is open), 0 otherwise.</p>
<p>The coverage parameter <span class="math inline">\(a_{ij}\)</span>
can be derived from a distance or cost parameter such as <span
class="math inline">\(c_{ij}\)</span> in the UFLP,</p>
<p>Then, the SCLP can be formulated as follows: <span
class="math display">\[
\min \sum\limits_{j \in J} x_j
\]</span> subject to $$ <span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
\sum\limits_{j\in J} a_{ij} x_j  &amp; \ge 1 &amp;\forall i \in I \\
x_j  &amp; \in \{0, 1\} &amp;\forall j \in J


\end{align}\]</span> $$</p>
<p>Sometimes we wish to minimize the total fixed cost of the opened
facilities, rather than the total number, in which case the following
objective function is appropriate <span class="math display">\[
\min \sum\limits_{j \in J} f_j x_j
\]</span></p>
<h3 id="the-maximal-covering-location-problem">8.4.2 The Maximal
Covering Location Problem</h3>
<p>The maximal covering location problem (MCLP) seeks to maximize the
total number ofdemands covered subject to a limit on the number of open
facilities.</p>
