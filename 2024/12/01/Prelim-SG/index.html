<p>The main challenges that need to be solved in the European Union are [1]:</p>
<ul>
<li>the decreasing availability of fossil and nuclear primary energy sources (PES) and,</li>
<li>accordingly, their rapidly increasing prices,</li>
<li>the 70% dependency of Central Europe on imported PES,</li>
<li>the increasing impact of greenhouse emissions on the environment.</li>

<p>The main difference in the figures consists in the differenti-ation  between  the  known  reserves  and  the  expected  increase  of  resources  which  could  be  exploited  by  non-traditional  technologies  (e.g.  hydraulic  fracturing  of  rock for gas exploitation).</p>
<p>Consequently, the European Union has set ambitious objectives for the year 2020 to:</p>
<ul>
<li>lower energy consumption by 20% by enhanced efficiency of energy use,</li>
<li>reduce CO2 emissions by 20% and,</li>
<li>ensure that 20% of the primary energy is generated by renewable energy resources (RES).</li>
</ul>
<p>Consequently,  electric  energy  has  to  carry  the  main  part  of  the  renewable  energy  production  by  having an annual share of &gt;30% in 2020. All of the member states of the European Union have set their individual targets in support of the common strategy for 2020.</p>
<p>A  Smart  Grid  is  an  electricity  network  that  can  intelligently  integrate  the  actions of all users connected to it—generators, consumers and those that do both—in order to efficiently deliver sustainable, economic and secure electric-ity supplies.</p>
<p>A  Smart  Grid  employs  innovative  products  and  services  together  with  intelli-gent monitoring, control, communication and self-healing technologies to:</p>
<ul>
<li>enable the network to integrate users with new requirements;</li>
<li>better facilitate the connection and operation of generators of all sizes and technologies;</li>
<li>enhance the efficiency in grid operations;</li>
<li>allow electricity consumers to play a part in optimizing the operation of the system;</li>
<li>provide consumers with more information and choice in the way they secure their electricity supplies;</li>
<li>improve the market functioning and consumer services;</li>
<li>significantly reduce the environmental impact of the total electricity supply system;</li>
<li>deliver enhanced levels of reliability, quality and security of supply</li>
</ul>
<p>Consequently,  a  Smart  Grid  supports  the  introduction  of  new  applications  with  far-reaching  impacts:  providing  the  capabilities  for  safe  and  controllable  inte-gration  of  more  renewable,  especially  volatile  energy  sources  (depending  on  the  weather  conditions)  as  well  of  new  categories  of  network  users  like  electric  vehicles  and  heat  pumps  into  the  network;  delivering  power  more  securely,</p>
<p>enabling con-sumers to be better informed about their electricity demand and to actively partici-pate in the electricity market by Demand Side Response on dynamic tariffs</p>
<h2 id="12-the-core-elements-of-the-european-smart-grid-vision"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#12-the-core-elements-of-the-european-smart-grid-vision"></a> 1.2 The Core Elements of the European Smart Grid Vision</h2>
<ul>
<li>Distributed energy resources (DER)</li>
<li>Renewable energy sources (RES)</li>
</ul>
<p>The  electricity  supply  of  the  future  will  be  shared  by  central  power  stations  and  distributed energy resources (DER)</p>
<p>Ultimately,  the  Smart  Grids  will  combine  existing  technologies—improved  and  updated—with innovative solutions</p>
<p>Centralized generation will still  play  an  important  role,  but  many  more  actors  will  be  involved  in  the  generation,  transmission, distribution and operation of the system, including the end consumers<br />
Based on these considerations, the core elements of the vision are defined in as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a <em>toolbox of proven technical solutions</em> that can be deployed rapidly and cost-effectively, enabling existing grids to accept power injections from distributed energy resources without contravening critical operational limits (such as voltage control, switching equipment capability and power flow capacity);</li>
<li>Establish <em>interfacing capabilities</em> that will allow new designs of grid equipment and new automation/control arrangements to be successfully interfaced with existing, traditional grid equipment;</li>
<li>Ensure <em>harmonization of regulatory and commercial frameworks</em> in Europe to facilitate cross-border trading of both power and grid services (such as reserve power, for instance Nordic hydropower), ensuring that they will accommodate a wide range of operating situations;</li>
<li>Establish shared technical standards and protocols that will <em>ensure open access</em>, enabling the deployment of equipment from any chosen manufacturer without fear of lock-into proprietary specifications. This applies to grid equipment, metering systems and control/automation architectures;</li>
<li>Develop <em>information, computing and telecommunication</em> systems that enable businesses to utilize innovative service arrangements to improve their efficiency and enhance their services to consumers.</li>
</ol>
<p>Advanced  Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) will be the key for:</p>
<ul>
<li>advanced distribution automation to enhance the quality of supply,</li>
<li>a coordinated energy management covering generation, storage and demand in the framework of virtual power plants (VPP),</li>
<li>provision of new metering services to the consumers including motivation  methods for efficient use of electricity
<ul>
<li>by dynamic tariffs,</li>
<li>by the real-time communication of information to the end consumers,</li>
<li>to visualize the current tariffs, their demand and the related costs.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<h2 id="21-new-trends-and-requirements-for-electricity-generation"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#21-new-trends-and-requirements-for-electricity-generation"></a> 2.1 New Trends and Requirements for Electricity Generation</h2>
<ul>
<li>Primary energy sources (PES):</li>

<p>Electricity generation is the process of electric energy production and requires the use  of  primary  energy  sources  (PES).  PES  is  defined  as  an  energy  form  that  is  available in nature and that has not yet been used in any conversion or transforma-tion process.</p>
<p>Nowadays, renewable energy sources (RES) such as geo-thermal power and con-centrated  solar  thermal  power  (CSP)  are  also  applied  for  the  electricity  generation  via heat.</p>
<p>Furthermore,  the  renewable  electricity  generation  is  increasingly  using  the  direct  conversion  of  mechanical  rotation  into  electricity  by  using  the  kinetic  energy  of  wind,  waves  and  flowing  water.</p>
<p>By 2015, the worldwide contributions of various PESs applied for electricity generation were:</p>
<ul>
<li>65.3% fossil PES (39.2% coal, 22.8% natural gas, 3.3% oil)</li>
<li>23.8% RES (15.9% hydroelectric, 6.8% other RES),</li>
<li>8.1% nuclear power.</li>
</ul>
<p>The  effect  of  excessive  amounts  of  CO2  in  the  atmosphere  is  the  increase  of  the overall temperature of the planet (global warming) with the consequence of a growing risk for extreme weather catastrophes (floods, hurricanes, heat waves and droughts)</p>
<p>Increasing  the  efficiency  of  electricity  generation  by  more  than  60%  may  be  achieved by three means:<br />
Increasing the efficiency of electricity generation by more than 60%:</p>

<h3 id="221-wind-power-plant"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#221-wind-power-plant"></a> 2.2.1 Wind Power Plant</h3>
<p>In general, wind power plants include many different concepts with regard to their construction,  type  of  generator,  type  of  network  interconnection,  type  of  control  system  as  well  as  type  of  operation.</p>
<p>The first modern wind turbines that were applied for electric power generation were  operated  at  a  constant  angular  speed  independent  of  the  wind  speed,  and  their  generators  were  directly  coupled  with  the  network.</p>
<p>The mechanical power of such turbines can be controlled by the following three aerodynamic principles</p>
<ul>
<li>stall control 失速控制</li>
<li>active-stall control 主动失速控制</li>
<li>pitch control 节距控制</li>
</ul>
<p>The adequate control system consists of the following main parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>pitch controller,</li>
<li>controller of network-side converter,</li>
<li>controller of rotor-side converter including the MPPT controller (maximum power point tracking 最大功率点跟踪控制器)</li>
</ul>
<p>China  became  the  world  market  leader  regarding  the  installed  wind  power  capacity  followed  by  the  USA  and  Germany</p>
<h3 id="222-utilization-of-solar-power-for-electricity-generation"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#222-utilization-of-solar-power-for-electricity-generation"></a> 2.2.2 Utilization of Solar Power for Electricity Generation</h3>
<ul>
<li>Photovoltaic technology (PV)</li>
<li>Concentrated solar power (CSP)</li>
</ul>
<p>Solar power is increasingly being used for electricity generation by converting the sunlight into electricity, either directly using the photovoltaic technology (PV), or indirectly using the principle of concentrated solar power (CSP).</p>
<p>PV converts the photon energy of the solar radiation into electric energy using the  photovoltaic  effect.  The  conversion  takes  place  within  solar  or  photovoltaic  cells, which are based on semiconductor technologies</p>
<p>The photovoltaic cells are connected and assembled to build a photo-voltaic  (or  solar)  panel.  Each  panel  is  rated  by  its  DC  output  power  under  standard  test  conditions,  and  typically  ranges  from  100  to  320  W.</p>
<p>Obviously,  the  economic  efficiency  of  PV  power  plants  is  higher  in  countries  with more intensive and continuous sun radiation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Main disadvantages of the PV technology</li>
</ul>
<p>The main disadvantage of the PV technology is the unavailability in darkness. The  application  of  CSP  systems  may  overcome  this  disadvantage  and  provide  an  around the clock electricity generation by using thermal storage capabilities</p>
<p>CSP  systems  use  lenses  or  mirrors  and  tracking  systems  to  focus  a  large  area  of  sunlight  into  a  small  beam.  The  focused  solar  energy  is  directed  to  heat  up  a  working  fluid  inside  absorber  tubes  or  other  containers.  The  concentrated  heat  is  then used as a heat source for a conventional power plant.</p>
<p>The upwind generator technology is based on the chimney principle. An area of ground is covered by a glass plane. The air under this cover is heated up by solar radiation and as a result of the air expansion the air flows through turbines into the chimney tower that is allocated in the center of the covered area. This principle is simple, but it provides a very low efficiency of about 1%. A rated power of some 100 MW would require an altitude of 1000 m and an area of 12 km2 [7]</p>
<h2 id="23-cogeneration-of-heat-and-power-applying-renewable-energy-sources"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#23-cogeneration-of-heat-and-power-applying-renewable-energy-sources"></a> 2.3 Cogeneration of Heat and Power Applying Renewable Energy Sources</h2>
<ul>
<li>Cogeneration of heat and power (CHP)</li>
</ul>
<p>A  significant  growth  in  the  shares  of  cogeneration  of  heat  and  power  (CHP)  is  one of the objectives of the European Union (see Sect. 1.1, SET Plan Table 1.1) to increase the energy efficiency</p>
<p>The use of RES in CHP has two positive effects, namely an increase up to 85% in the overall (electrical and thermal) energy efficiency and a reduction of the CO2 emissions.</p>
<p>The following RES—CHP technologies are currently being applied:</p>
<ul>
<li>Thermal steam power plants based on bio mass combustion,</li>
<li>Gas turbines fired by bio gas,</li>
<li>Gas engine driven by bio gas,</li>
<li>Combined Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT) using bio gas,</li>
<li>Geothermal plants with steam turbines,</li>
<li>Fuel cells</li>
</ul>
<p>The CHP plants may be optimized for heat or electricity production. The  operation with  an  optimized  heat  production  offers  the  higher  efficiency  with  a  minimum  of  energy  losses.  However,  the  electricity  market  offers  a  higher  optimization  potential  according  to  the  economic  benefits.</p>
<p>the inclusion of thermal storage capabilities allows for a more flexible and economic optimum operation of the electricity generation depending on the related market prices. Thermal storage helps to increase the economic benefits</p>
<h3 id="231-bio-fuel-power-plants"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#231-bio-fuel-power-plants"></a> 2.3.1 Bio Fuel Power Plants</h3>
<ul>
<li>Advantages</li>
</ul>
<p>The use of bio fuel provides two major advantages in the sense of the Smart Grid concept</p>
<ol>
<li>Biological materials contain energy that is derived directly from chlorophyll (叶绿素) <em>photosynthesis</em> (光合作用).</li>
<li>Bio fuel is the only renewable energy source that does not depend on the weather and that guarantees a continuous energy generation.</li>
</ol>
<p>Consequently,  the  bio  fuel  is  being  used  to  replace  energy  derived  from  fossil  fuels, and thereby reduce emissions of greenhouse gases.</p>
<ul>
<li>可以直接燃烧 (combustion) 固体生物质 (solid biomass)，如木屑、灰尘、树皮等</li>
</ul>
<p>Heat  and  power  generation  in  CHPs  can  be  made  by  direct  combustion  of  solid  biomass  such  as  wood  chips,  dust,  bark  and  shavings. Another  practical  solution  is  the  gasification  of  such  biomass  material.  Both  conversion  paths  are  the  most  important  for  biomass  based  cogeneration.</p>
<p>The sources of biomass are quite different and have to be converted in relation to their present form. Sources of biomass can be wastes or residues from biologi-cal or industrial processes</p>
<p>China will become the most important growth market for biomass power plants in  the  next  ten  years.  With  an  increase  of  around  750  MW  per  year,  China  will  become the national market with the highest sales in the world</p>
<p>A  further  benefit  of  bio  gas  power  plants  is  that  they  are  able  to  generate   electricity in a combined cycle and, in this way, to increase the plant’s electricity efficiency.</p>
<ul>
<li>Combined ctcke gas turbine (CCGT, 联合循环燃气轮机)</li>
</ul>
<p>This is called a Combined Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT) plant, and can achieve an electric  efficiency  of  around  60%,  in  contrast  to  a  single  cycle  steam  power  plant  which  is  limited  to  efficiencies  of  around  35–42%</p>
<h3 id="232-geothermal-power-plants"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#232-geothermal-power-plants"></a> 2.3.2 Geothermal Power Plants</h3>
<p>Geothermal power plants generate electricity from geothermal energy. Geothermal energy  refers  to  heat  within  the  earth  and  originates  from  the  residual  heat  from  the formation of the earth and the radioactive decay of isotopes inside the planet, which  act  as  natural  nuclear  power.  Geothermal  electricity  generation  requires  transferring  the  naturally  occurring  high  temperature  from  deep  underground  to  the surface by fluid circulation</p>
<h3 id="232-fuel-cells"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#232-fuel-cells"></a> 2.3.2 Fuel Cells</h3>
<p>A fuel cell is a device that converts the chemical energy from a fuel into electric-ity through a chemical reaction with oxygen or another oxidizing agent. Hydrogen is  the  most  common  fuel,  but  hydrocarbons  such  as  natural  gas  and  alcohols  like  methanol are also applicable</p>
<p>The fuel cell is an efficient energy conversion system that converts the  chemical energy  of  the  fuel  directly  into  electricity.  With  this  principle,  only  one  energy  conversion step required: chemical energy into electrical energy</p>
<p>There  are  many  types  of  fuel  cells,  but  they  all  consist  of  two  electrodes  (anode–cathode)  and  an  electrolyte  that  allows  charges  to  move  between  the  two  electrodes of the fuel cell</p>
<p>The  hydrogen  proton  migrates  through  the  channel  structure  of  the  mem-brane on the other side to the cathode and the electron moves through an external electrical conductor from the anode to the cathode</p>
<p>he directed external movement of the electron creates electric energy. However,  the  electron  flow  through  the  conductor  creates  a  direct  current  (DC).  The DC power has to be converted into AC power for the electric network access.</p>
<p>Once reaching the cathode through the membrane channels, the protons recom-bine  with  the  electrons  which  reached  the  cathode  via  the  conductor.  Both  react  with the oxygen to create water H2O.</p>
<ul>
<li>PEM: Proton-Exchange Membrane: 质子-外热膜</li>
<li>LT PEMFC: Low temperature PEM fuel cell</li>
<li>HT PEMFC: high temperature PEM fuel cell</li>
</ul>
<p>The  benefits  of  the  HT  PEMFC  compared to the LT PEMFC are the better tolerance to impurities in the gases and the fact that humidification of the reaction gases is not necessary. The main disad-vantage of HT PEMFC is primarily due to the higher system complexity.</p>
<p>However, the water management of both LT and HT PEM FCs is crucial to the cell performance: too much water will flood the membrane, too little will dry it; in both cases, power output will drop. Stable PEMFC operation therefore requires a humidification module as an additional system component to solve these issues.</p>
<ul>
<li>DMFCs: Direct-methanol fuel cells 甲醇燃料电池</li>
</ul>
<p>Direct-methanol  fuel  cells  (DMFCs)  are  a  subcategory  of  the  PEMFC  and  use  methanol  as  fuel.  Their  main  advantage  lies  in  the  ease  of  transport  of  methanol,  the high energy- density and the liquid stability under all environmental conditions</p>
<ul>
<li>PAFC Phosphoric acids fuel cells 磷酸燃料电池</li>
</ul>
<p>Phosphoric  acid  fuel  cells  (PAFC)  use  phosphoric  acid  as  an  electrolyte. They  were  the  first  fuel  cells  to  be  commercialized.  Improved  stability  in  performance  and low costs have made the PAFC a good candidate for early stationary applica-tions between 100 and 400 kW</p>
<p>Disadvantages include rather low energy—density, the low energy efficiency of 37–42% and the aggressive electrolyte.</p>
<ul>
<li>MCFC: Medium temperature fuel cell 中温燃料电池</li>
</ul>
<p>The medium temperature fuel cell MCFC operates in the range of 600–700 °C and has a molten-carbonate electrolyte</p>
<ul>
<li>SOFC: High temperature fuel cell 高温燃料电池</li>
</ul>
<p>The  high  temperature  fuel  cell  SOFC  (800–1000  °C)  is  characterized  by  a  high  tolerance  against  impurities  in  the  gases  and  has  a  high  efficiency.  Due  to  the extremely high temperature, however, only selected materials fulfill the corre-sponding requirements</p>
<ul>
<li>Usage of fuel cells</li>
</ul>
<p>Because of their low weight, as compared to batteries, and their efficient energy supply, fuel cells are used in the aerospace industry and for submarines as auxiliary power units</p>
<p>Fuel cell systems can be applied in the stationary sector to supply domestic or industrial systems, as well as in mobile applications for use in vehicles, elevators and motorcycles</p>
<p>Fuel  cells  have  been  introduced  for  cogeneration  of  heat  and  power  in  a  num-ber  of  projects</p>
<ul>
<li>Limits of fuel cells</li>
</ul>
<p>However, for the most part, fuel cell systems are not yet economically competitive for the large scale electricity generation in power systems. Only through further cost reductions and long-term stability of the fuel cells, will this technology become usa-ble for the establishment of power plants with significant power capacities. Scientists and experts are intensely working to improve the fuel cell technologies worldwide</p>

<h3 id="241-introduction-and-categories-of-electricity-storage"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#241-introduction-and-categories-of-electricity-storage"></a> 2.4.1 Introduction and Categories of Electricity Storage</h3>
<ul>
<li>EESS: 电能储能系统</li>
</ul>
<p>Electric  Energy  Storage  Systems  (EESS)  are  usually  classified  by  two  criteria:  the  rated  power  and  time  of  discharge  which  corresponds  with  the  energy  stor-age capacity.</p>
<p>According to these criteria three use cases of EESS may be defined: Power Quality, Power Bridging and Energy Management.</p>
<p>Ensuring  Power  Quality  often  requires  providing  supporting  energy  to  avoid  voltage  sags,  flicker  or  supply  interruptions.  The  requested  power  is  needed  for  short time intervals (in the range of seconds and minutes) and may be rated from a few kW (kilowatt) to a few MW (megawatt).<br />
Typical EESS for this use case may be based on the technologies of:</p>
<ul>
<li>High power fly wheels</li>
<li>superconducting magnetic energy storage</li>
<li>high power super capacitors,</li>
<li>several types of batteries.</li>
</ul>
<p>Power  Bridging  is  mostly  used  to  provide  an  uninterrupted  supply  if  the  main  power fails.<br />
In principle, the DC power supply of the control and pro-tection  facilities  in  substations  belongs  to  the  power  bridging  concept.<br />
Typical EESS technologies for Power Bridging are:</p>
<ul>
<li>high energy super capacitors,</li>
<li>several types of batteries</li>
</ul>
<p>Energy  Management  is  mainly  used  for  power  balancing,  peak  shaving,  and  for  energy  storage  during  low  price  periods  and  injecting  energy  during  high  price  periods.</p>
<p>This  use  case  will  play  a  significantly  growing  role  in  the  Smart  Grid  environment for covering of energy deficits in general and for storing excesses of renewable power.<br />
The EESS technologies suitable for energy management tasks include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pumped-storage hydro-electric power plants (PSHPP),  抽水蓄能水电站</li>
<li>compressed air energy storage (CAES), 压缩空气储能器</li>
<li>high energy batteries of various technologies,</li>
<li>indirect principles like
<ul>
<li>“power to gas” and</li>
<li>a combination of thermal storage/electric heating to ensure a more flexible contribution of CHP plants for energy management</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Because of the growth of more fluctuating power consumption and the increasing installed capacity of volatile renewable energy technologies with weather depend-ent  generation,  the  need  for  the  use  case  “Energy  Management”  is  stronger  than  ever</p>
<h3 id="242-long-term-bulk-energy-storage-plants"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#242-long-term-bulk-energy-storage-plants"></a> 2.4.2 Long-Term Bulk Energy Storage Plants</h3>
<ul>
<li>PAHPP: Pumped-storage hydroelectric power pants 抽水蓄能水电发电厂</li>
</ul>
<p>Pumped-storage  hydroelectric  power  plants  (PSHPP)  provide  the  largest-capacity  form  of  electric  energy  storage.  They  consist  of  upper  and  lower  reservoirs,  the  connecting tube system, the power plant chamber and the substation</p>
<p>The  main  parameters  defining  the  generation  power  capability  of  the  plant  are  the  inner  diameter  D  (cross  section)  of  the  connecting  tubes  and  the  difference  of  the  heights  ΔH  between  the  upper  reservoir  and  the  allocation  of  the  turbine–pump aggregate.</p>
<p>The  optimum  operation  mode  of  PSHPP  simply  consists  of  using  the  best  tur-bine  time  and  pump  time  depending  on  the  demand  and  market  prices  to  shift  as  much  water  as  possible  between  the  upper  and  the  lower  water  reservoirs.</p>
<p>PSHPPs are currently used to store the electric energy during times of weak load and low energy prices by filling up the upper water reservoir and then generate the electric energy during peak load and high price times by using the potential and kinetic energy of the water flowing down through the tubes into the lower reservoir</p>
<p>The  energy  efficiency  of  the  PSHPPs  varies  in  practice  between  70  and  80%  depending  on  the  age,  the  technology  and  the  geographical  conditions.</p>
<ul>
<li>CAES: Compressed Air Energy Storage 压缩空气储能器</li>
</ul>
<p>Compressed  Air  Energy  Storage  (CAES)  is  a  further  way  to  store  bulk  energy   generated at one time for use at another time</p>
<p>Due  to  the  large  volume  of  air  to  be  compressed,  CAES  systems  often  use  existing large underground caverns. The main types of caverns suitable for CAES are salt cavern</p>
<p>The efficiency of the storage improves signifi-cantly if the heat generated during compression can be stored and then used for the expansion process</p>
<p>There  are  several  ways  in  which  a  CAES  system  can  manage  the  heat,  for  example the adiabatic or the isothermal principles</p>
<p>It is based on a combination of a gas turbine and a compressed air combustion engine.<br />
原理：It is based on a combination of a gas turbine (燃气涡轮机) and a compressed air combustion engine (压缩空气内燃机).</p>
<ul>
<li>During <em>low-price</em> weak load periods, the motor consumes power to compress and store the air in the underground salt caverns.</li>
<li>During <em>peak load</em> periods, the process is reversed and the compressed air is returned to the surface. The air is used twice:
<ul>
<li><em>burn the gas fuel</em> in the combustion chamber of the gas turbine</li>
<li>provide <em>supplement rotation power</em> for the compressed air combustion engine</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This combination allows a significant enhancement of the efficiency of the overall plant.  In  a  pure  gas  turbine  a  significant  energy  contribution  is  required  for  com-pressing the combustion air.</p>
<ul>
<li>Stationary Electric Batteries 蓄电池</li>
</ul>
<p>An  electric  battery  is  a  device  consisting  of  electrochemical  cells  that  are  able  to  convert  chemical  energy  into  electric  energy  (discharge)  and  vice  versa  (charge)</p>
<p>There are a number of technical parameters besides the capital and operational expenses that influence the economic efficiency of the battery applications</p>
<p>This  concerns,  among  others,  such  parameters  as  the  life  time  of  the  battery  system,  the  cycle  durability,  the  charging–discharging  efficiency,  the  self-  dis-charge and the energy density</p>
<p>The  traditionally  used  battery  system  in  the  past  was  the  lead-acid  battery  that is mainly applied,</p>
<p>Its  basic  design  incorporates  two  lead  electrodes  immersed  in  a  sulfuric  acid.  During  the  charge  and  discharge  phases,  hydrogen  ions  (H+)  travel  in  the  acid  solution  between  the  two  electrodes  and  electrons  travel  in  the  external  circuit.</p>
<p>The  analysis  of  the  technical  and  economic  parameters  demonstrates  that  the  NaS,  Redox  flow  and  Li-ion  batteries  are  more  suitable  for  energy  management  applications</p>
<ul>
<li>The redox flow battery  氧化还原电池<br />
The redox flow battery can offer almost unlimited capacity by using larger and larger storage tanks, it can be left completely discharged for long periods with no damage  and  it  can  be  recharged  simply  by  replacing  the  electrolyte  if  no  power  source is available to charge it.</li>
</ul>
<p>The  lithium-ion  battery  family  is  based  on  the  principle  that  the  lithium  ions  move  between  the  anode  and  cathode  of  the  cell  to  carry  the  charges.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The cathodes are composed of metal oxide containing lithium particles,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the anodes are made of layered graphite (石墨) carbon.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>充电阶段：阴极的锂原子成为离子，并穿过电解质分离器到达碳阳极。到达阳极后，锂离子与电子结合以锂原子的形式沉积在碳层之间。</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>放电阶段：相反的过程会发生：锂原子失去电子到阳极，并以离子的形式返回阴极。<br />
During the charging phase, lithium atoms at the cathode become ions and traverse the electrolyte separator to the carbon anode. Upon reaching the anode, the lithium ions combine with electrons and are deposited between the carbon layers as lithium atoms. During the discharge phase, the reverse process occurs: The lithium atoms lose electrons to the anode and travel back as ions to the cathode.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Li-ion  batteries  are  characterized  by  light  weight,  high  energy  density,  high  efficiency and low self-discharge rates. To provide more power, connecting many small batteries in a parallel circuit is more efficient</p>
<p>However,  lithium-ion  batteries  can  be  dangerous  under  some  conditions  since  they contain a flammable electrolyte and are also kept pressurized. This requires high quality standards for these batteries consisting of many supplement safety features</p>
<p>The  application  of  stationary  batteries  for  energy  management  applications  throughout  the  world  is  still  limited  due  to  economic  reasons.  The  most  battery  storage systems are generally still expensive</p>
<ul>
<li>“Power to Gas&quot; by Electrolysis and Methanation<br />
When the contribution of volatile RES becomes higher than 20% of the total consumption, the external storage will become important.</li>
</ul>
<p>If  the  surplus  of  electricity  may  be  used  to  produce  hydrogen  and other fuel gases, then it can be utilized fully whenever there is a demand. The production  of  fuel  gases  will  be  an  instrument  to  utilize  the  excesses  of  available  energy</p>
<p>The hydrogen and other gases produced by electrolysis or methanation can  be  used  as  a  fuel  for  powering  combustion  engines  or  for  fuel  cells</p>
<p>However,  the  energy  balance  of  the  hydrogen  production  is  negative,  i.e.  the  energy  input  for  the  electrolysis  is  higher  than  the  energy  that  can  be  generated  afterwards.</p>
<ul>
<li>Electrolysis 点解</li>
</ul>
<p>The  key  process  of  electrolysis  is  the  interchange  of  atoms  and  ions  by  the  removal  or  addition  of  electrons  from  the  external circuit.</p>
<p>The power to gas process for this concept is performed in a two- step approach</p>
<ol>
<li>Hydrogen is produced in the electrolysis process</li>
<li>A part of hydrogen will be used for methanation</li>
<li>Methane can be used to supply various gas consumers and as a fuel for electricity generation</li>
</ol>
<p>For  example,  the  small  Norwegian  island  municipality  Utsira  is  supplied  by  an  energy  system  including  wind  power  plants  and  a  storage  system  consisting  of  an  electrolysis unit, a compressed air storage system, a fuel cell and a hydrogen turbine.</p>
<ul>
<li>Electric Energy Management by Thermal Storage</li>
</ul>
<p>Thermal  storage  consists  of  the  temporary  production  and  storage  of  heat  for  a  later use.</p>
<p>The expenses for thermal storage are lower than for electricity storage.</p>
<p>thermal storage becomes one option to contribute for energy manage-ment  and  provide  reliable  energy  supplies.</p>
<p>Therefore,  thermal  storage  will  play  a  growing role in the electric energy management in different ways</p>
<p>This principle can also be used to compensate an excess of electric energy and to save energy for cooling in periods of weak renewable electricity generation</p>
<p>A  combination  of  thermal  storage,  electric  heating  and  solar  heat  generation  is  used  also  for  municipal  district  heating  systems.</p>
<p>For efficiency reasons, the CHP plants are mainly scheduled in accordance with the  heat  demand,  which  depends  on  the  weather  conditions  and  is  significantly  reduced  in  the  summer  time  when  only  the  provision  of  hot  water  and  industrial  heat is required.</p>
<p>The  introduction  of  thermal  storage  units  into  the  CHP  systems  will  allow  a  much more flexible scheduling of the CHP with a focus on the electricity market.<br />
Furthermore,  the  combination  of  electric  heating  and  thermal  storage  may  play  a  significant role in the energy management of the future.<br />
The extension of CHP plant provides the following opportunities:</p>
<ul>
<li>The CHP plant produces electric power that is market driven in high price/high demand periods and is independent of the thermal power schedule. The excess of thermal energy will be stored.</li>
<li>In low price/low demand periods the electricity generation of the CHP plant is shut down and the heat demand is covered by the thermal storage.</li>
<li>Excesses of renewable electricity production may be compensated by electric heating</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="25-enhanced-flexibility-requirements-for-controllable-power-plants"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#25-enhanced-flexibility-requirements-for-controllable-power-plants"></a> 2.5 Enhanced Flexibility Requirements for Controllable Power Plants</h2>
<p>The compensation management of the fluctuations of volatile renewable electricity generation requires the coordinated operation of all definitely controllable sources of  power  generation  and  demand:  power  plants,  storage  plants  and  demand  side  management DSM.</p>
<p>A short start-up duration is one of the requested features to meet the fluctuation challenges.</p>
<p>he  flexible  controllability  of  the  power  plant  includes  further  parameters  like  the  power  gradient,  the  flexibility  interval  and  the  minimum  power  generation  requested for a stable operation</p>
<p>However,  the  flexi-ble reaction to fluctuations caused by RES requires the fast availability of  certain volumes of control power from power plants operated at the minimum generation level.</p>
<p>Consequently, the flexibility of the remaining thermoelectric power generation requires</p>
<ul>
<li>high power control gradients without reduction of the plant life time,</li>
<li>the availability of high power gradients within the whole flexibility interval,</li>
<li>the achievement of a minimum generation level of 20%,</li>
<li>maintaining high efficiency even under reduced generation conditions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Another  economic  challenge  concerns  the  motivation  for  investment  to  con-struct  and  operate  new  power  plants. This  challenge  will  change  the  pricing  con-ditions  and  will  require  the  trade  of  “power  gradient  products”.</p>
<p>To conclude the considerations in both Chaps. 1 and 2 it can be stated:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Smart Grid concept requires a significant enhancement of <em>flexibility</em> regarding the electricity generation processes and the power system operations. Furthermore, it is necessary that the generation process becomes “Smart”.</li>
<li>Both the Smart Grid and Smart Generation processes will ensure the <em>sustainable and environmentally friendly electric power supply</em> of the future. They will also lead to enormous technical developments in both fields and, in principle, a system strategy for “Smart Electric Power Systems” is required.</li>

<p>Electric  power  flows  through  several  substations  at  different  voltage  levels  on  its  way between the bulk power stations and the end consumers.</p>
<p>However, typically, the substations transform voltage from high to low and/or vice versa<br />
Substations may perform any of several other important functions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>voltage control,</li>
<li>reactive power control or power factor correction,</li>
<li>power flow control by phase shifting transformers or power electronic plants,</li>
<li>UHV, EHV or HV DC/AC conversion to connect High Voltage DC (HVDC) lines,</li>
<li>connection of two un-synchronous power systems by UHV/EHV/HV DC coupling</li>
</ul>
<p>A  small  “switching  substation”  may  contain  little  more  than  one  busbar  plus  some feeders.</p>

<p>Substations 变电站</p>
<p>Each  network  element  (line,  transformer,  coupling,  voltage  transformer)  con-nected  to  the  busbars  builds  a  switch  bay.  The  switch  bays  are  equipped  with  several  primary  devices  (dimensioned  for  the  primary  voltages  and  currents)  and  secondary  devices  for  control,  measurement  and  protection.<br />

<p>创新型空气绝缘开关设备技术</p>
<p>The  most  valuable  device  of  the  switchgear  is  the  circuit  breaker.</p>
<p>The  circuit  breaker  has  to  interrupt  high  short  circuit  currents  which  may  reach  values  up  to  80 kA in extra high voltage networks.</p>
<ul>
<li>AIS: Air insulated switchgear technology</li>
</ul>
<p>In the past various types of circuit breakers were installed in the substations such as the bulk oil tank circuit breaker, the minimum oil circuit breaker or the air blast circuit breaker.</p>
<p>In the last few decades there has been a shift from AIS to using only gas insulated circuit breakers in the UHV, EHV and HV substations</p>
<p>The  isolators  are  motor  driven  and  the  opening  or  closing  operations  may  require a few seconds</p>
<h3 id="313-gas-insulated-switchgear"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#313-gas-insulated-switchgear"></a> 3.1.3 Gas Insulated Switchgear</h3>
<p>sulfur  hexafluoride  is  a  superior  dielectric  gas  that  is also used in gas insulated switchgears at moderate pressures for phase to phase and  phase  to  ground  insulation.<br />
The main drivers for using gas insulated switchgear are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Restricted space availability what is important in highly populated or mountainous areas,</li>
<li>Expensive land acquisition or legal restrictions,</li>
<li>Requirements for environmental compatibility or community acceptance,</li>
<li>Aggressive environmental conditions, e.g. coastal sites or industrial sites,</li>
<li>Heavy weather conditions, e.g. strong wind, snow and ice,</li>
<li>Seismic (地震活动) activity with the need for high seismic stability through a low centre of gravity,</li>
<li>Extension or refurbishment or upgrading of AIS under restricted space availability.</li>
</ul>
<p>Besides the fundamental space reduction the compact GIS design provides the following additional benefits:<br />
Benefits of Gas insulated switchgear (GIS):</p>
<ul>
<li>Short and economic planning and delivery period possible through customer-tailored and pre-defined combinations of switchgear modules,</li>
<li>Short and economic installation period possible through factory pre-assembled and pre-tested units,</li>
<li>Restricted foundations, e.g. in mountainous or river areas realized with outdoor-GIS,</li>
<li>High level of availability through encapsulation and modular, service friendly design,</li>
<li>Minimal maintenance efforts realized through encapsulation of moving parts and less insulators,</li>
<li>High degree of safety for operating personnel realized through earthed encapsulation,</li>
<li>Long operating life: &gt;50 years.</li>

<p>The power system control is performed in a four tiered bottom up hierarchy:</p>
<ul>
<li>Process level</li>
<li>Bay control level</li>
<li>Substation control level</li>
<li>Network control level</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/YangSuoly/Images/Prelim/202412011142561.png" alt="Pasted image 20241019183144" /></p>
<p>At the process level:</p>
<ul>
<li>binary status signals indicate, for example, the positions of the switchgear or the transformer tap changer,</li>
<li>analogue measurement data (voltage, current) are available at the interfaces of the instrument transformers,</li>
<li>binary output commands are set for the control of switchgear, tap changers and various equipment for protection, automation or auxiliary needs,</li>
<li>analogue target values may be set to change the behavior of regulation facilities (e.g. the target value for voltage can be set to the transformer voltage controller)</li>
</ul>
<p>The  bay  level  is  equipped  with  intelligent  electronic  devices  (IEDs)  which  provide  the  interfaces  for  the  process  data  acquisitions.<br />
At the bay level the IEDs (Intelligent electronic devices  智能电子设备) perform two main tasks:</p>
<ol>
<li>Bay control and processing of the basic data for the Substation Automation System (SAS), data exchange with the substation control level,</li>
<li>Protection of the bay related network assets against stress and damages caused by disturbances and/or critical state conditions (e.g. overloading, over voltages).</li>
</ol>
<p>At the bay level the IEDs perform two main tasks:<br />
The process data can be</p>
<ul>
<li>visualized in the device screens on local request and</li>
<li>used in a programmable logic to start special automation programs,</li>
<li>communicated to the upper level of the substation control</li>
</ul>
<p>Appropriate  command  and  impact  signals  for  the  process  can  be  performed  in  the following ways:<br />
可用如下方式执行适当的命令和冲击信号：</p>
<ul>
<li>generated by automation algorithms (e.g. voltage control, switch sequences, protection trips),</li>
<li>initiated by the operator locally using the control facilities of the bay devices,</li>
<li>received from the substation control level via communication- either initiated by personnel at the substation control level or transferred from the network control level to the substation control level and forwarded from here to the process</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Station control level</strong></p>
<p>The  substation  control  level  provides  an  interactive  work  place  for  the  operator  with control and visualization elements.</p>
<p>The substation control level provides communication interfaces to the network control center and, if requested, to further network service providers like the asset and maintenance management, network planning or protection supervision. Not all available  data  is  communicated  between  all  of  the  levels  instead  the  information  exchange has to be engineered</p>
<p><strong>Network control center</strong></p>
<p>he  network  control  center  observes  and  controls  all  substations  of  the  net-work.  Furthermore,  the  power  in-feed  of  the  connected  power  stations  and  the  power  exchange  with  the  neighboring  power  stations  are  managed  on  this  level.</p>
<p>The transmission system operators (TSO) build the “control area” in the territory of their network, control the reserve power availability and ensure in this way the frequency stability</p>
<h3 id="322-protection-and-control-in-substations"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#322-protection-and-control-in-substations"></a> 3.2.2 Protection and Control in Substations</h3>
<p>The  substation  control  technology  was  stable  and  remained  unchanged  for  about 100 years from the beginning of the electricity supply until the 1990s.</p>
<p>The  protection  technology  has  also  changed  within  the  last  few  decades—from  the  electromechanical  relay  schemes  completed  on  panels  to  analogue  pro-tection  cubicles  to  digital  protection  devices</p>
<p>intelligent electronic devices “IED”, which are char-acterized  by  the  ability  to  combine  a  wide  variety  of  functions  in  a  configurable  way  and  thus  also  integrate  protection,  automation  and  bay  control  tasks  in  one  device</p>
<p>The protection cannot avoid disturbances but minimize the consequences through:</p>
<ul>
<li>rapid, secure and selective disconnection of the faulty equipment,</li>
<li>automatic reclosing for supply recovering in case of transient failures,</li>
<li>logging and recording the disturbance and supporting a fast network recovery</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="323-control-center-technologies"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#323-control-center-technologies"></a> 3.2.3 Control Center Technologies</h3>
<p>The  transmission  system  operation  at  the  highest  level  performs  two  basic  functions</p>
<ul>
<li>Energy Management System (EMS) and</li>
<li>Network Supervision, Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA).</li>
</ul>
<p>The power system control is structured in the hierarchical levels transmis-sion,  sub-transmission  (or  regional  distribution)  and  local  distribution</p>
<p>The control center of transmission systems is often called “dispatching center” in the context with the combination of both functions</p>
<p>The  technology  of  the  dispatching  centers  is  mainly  based  on  components  which  are  commercially  available  on  the  markets  for  computer  and  communica-tion  technologies.</p>
<p>The SCADA functions in the dispatching center cover all connected users of the network and are, in principle, similar to the substation SCADA. The complete map-ping of the physical network infrastructure within the dispatching system is stand-ard.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Energy Management System (EMS)</li>
</ul>
<p>The Energy Management System (EMS) is operated in closed cooperation with the day-ahead and intra-day energy spot markets. Based on the load and renewable energy forecasts  each  time  interval  has  to  be  covered  by  the  most  economic  mix  of  energy  sources  available.</p>
<p>Expert  systems  build  a  separate  functional  block  and  support  the  operators  in  finding  the  best  solutions  to  manage  congestions  and  to  avoid  critical  network  conditions</p>
<p>Besides the communication with the remote control console for emergency<br />
operations further gateways are supported:</p>
<ul>
<li>Communication with other dispatching centers,</li>
<li>Bridges to other enterprise services like
<ul>
<li>network planning,</li>
<li>asset management,</li>
<li>maintenance management,</li>
<li>financial control,</li>
<li>energy trading,</li>
<li>training simulator for education</li>

<h2 id="33-transmission-technologies"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#33-transmission-technologies"></a> 3.3 Transmission Technologies</h2>
<h3 id="331-overview"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#331-overview"></a> 3.3.1 overview</h3>
<p>The transmission and sub-transmission technologies are classified according to the mechanical construction principle as<br />
Classes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Overhead lines</li>
<li>Underground or submarine lines which can perform as
<ul>
<li>Cable lines</li>
<li>Gas insulated lines (GIL)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>related to the voltage level as:</p>
<ul>
<li>HV Lines (&gt;60–&lt;220 kV)</li>
<li>EHV Lines (extra-high voltage ≥220–&lt;800 kV)</li>
<li>UHV Lines (ultra-high voltage ≥800–1200 kV)</li>
</ul>
<p>according to the physical transmission principle as:</p>
<ul>
<li>AC Lines or</li>
<li>DC Lines.</li>
</ul>
<p>The AC transfer capacity is limited by two parameters:<br />
AC transfer capacity lis limited by:</p>
<ul>
<li>maximum transmission distance,</li>
<li>maximum transmission power.</li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore, in the case of faults the voltages decline and the transfer capacity is reduced accordingly.</p>
<p>The  related  temperature  increase  of  the  conductors  also  limits  the  power  transfer  capacity</p>
<h3 id="332-ac-transmission"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#332-ac-transmission"></a> 3.3.2 AC-Transmission</h3>
<p>AC  overhead  transmission  lines  are  constructed  with  steel  towers,  porcelain,  sil-icone  or  glass  insulators,  ground  and  phase  conductors  consisting  of  a  steel  core  providing the mechanical stability and aluminium housing providing a low electric resistance</p>
<p>The bundling of conductors starts with the EHV level and has two functions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Increase of the equivalent diameter of the conductor surface to decrease the electric field strength “E” at the conductor surface. In the result the energy losses caused by the corona effects (ionization of the air environment) may be reduced.</li>
<li>Growth of the conductor cross section and reduction of the electric resistance: In the result the energy losses caused by the current flow may be reduced.</li>
</ol>
<p>The  capacitance  is  influenced  by  the  diameter  of  the  bundled  conductors  (increase)  and  the  distances  between  the  phases  and  to  the  ground  (decrease).  Therefore, a trend dependency of the voltage level is not clearly visible.</p>
<h3 id="333-dc-transmission"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#333-dc-transmission"></a> 3.3.3 DC-Transmission</h3>
<p>The conversion of AC to DC power and vice versa requires an active and fast con-trol of the valves in the converter stations</p>
<p>Two converter valve technologies are currently available:</p>
<ul>
<li>Current source converters (CSC) or line commutated converters (LCC) applying light triggered thyristors (LTT).</li>
<li>Voltage source converters (VSC) applying insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBT).</li>
</ul>
<p>The  development  of  HV-DC  circuit-breakers  has  become  a  high  priority  in  recent years. Basically, DC circuit breakers may be realized by<br />
DC circuit breakers:</p>
<ul>
<li>pyrotechnic type interruption,</li>
<li>traditional AC circuit breakers modified for DC,</li>
<li>electronic current control by semiconductors,</li>
<li>a combination of such solutions.</li>
</ul>

<p>The  power  system  of  the  future  must  be  flexible,  secure,  cost  effective  and  envi-ronmentally  compatible.  The  combination  of  these  tasks  can  be  tackled  with  the  help of intelligent solutions</p>
<ul>
<li>FACTS: Flexible AC Transmission System</li>
</ul>
<p>Flexible AC Transmission Systems (FACTS) will play an increasingly important role in the future development of power systems.</p>
<p>The impact of FACTS on the power transfer is achieved by:</p>
<ol>
<li>Parallel compensation: control of the voltages on one or both sides of the transmission line. Higher voltages cause a higher power transfer.</li>
<li>Series compensation: reduction of the line reactance through serially connected capacitors.</li>
<li>Load flow control: influence of the voltage angle difference between the line ends.</li>

<p>The installed power of wind parks and photovoltaic plants will grow dramatically and, depending on the development concepts for the energy mix, it may exceed the peak  power  demand  in  a  control  area.  The  power  generation  from  wind  and  sun  varies significantly and influences the loading of the network assets</p>
<p>The  photovoltaic  plants  deliver  power  during  the  daylight  only,  and  during  the  day each cloud can lead to intermittency.</p>

<p>The innovations are focussed on the introduction of an EHV DC overlay network</p>
<p>During  strong  wind  periods  the AC  network  is  heavily  loaded  and  high  losses  of  reactive  power  may  lead  to  voltage  reductions  accompanied  by  the  dan-ger  of  voltage  collapses. Alternately,  during  weak  wind  periods  the AC  network  is  weakly  loaded  and  an  excess  of  reactive  power  may  cause  over-voltages.</p>

<p>The  distribution  networks  are  designed  to  distribute  the  electric  energy  to  the  consumers  in  a  maximum  economic  and  reliable  way.<br />
herefore,  in  this  chapter  the  considerations  are  mainly  focussed  on  the  prac-tice  of  the  local  distribution  networks  at  the  medium  and  low  voltage  levels.</p>
<h2 id="42-primary-and-secondary-mv-distribution"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#42-primary-and-secondary-mv-distribution"></a> 4.2 Primary and Secondary MV Distribution</h2>
<p>The  MV  distribution  network  begins  at  the  transformer  in-feed  from  the  over-laying  network  (mainly  110  kV),  whereby  the  transformer  is  connected  to  the  medium voltage busbar</p>
<p>The primary distribution equipment has to be dimensioned for load currents up  to  4000  A  and  for  short  circuit  currents  up  to  72  kA.</p>
<p>The  feeders  connected  to  the  busbar  of  the  substation  are  equipped  with  circuit  breakers  and  protection  schemes</p>
<p>The secondary distribution network leads downstream outside the substation to the supply areas. Each feeder builds a chain connecting the subsequent MV/LV transformer terminals.</p>
<p>Distribution  terminals  are  used  for  a  wide  spread  extension  of  the  MV  net-work  with  parallel  feeders.</p>

<h2 id="44-neutral-grounding-concepts"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#44-neutral-grounding-concepts"></a> 4.4 Neutral Grounding Concepts</h2>
<p>The  method  of  neutral  grounding  does  not  influence  the  behaviour  of  a  network  under normal operating conditions.</p>
<p>However, in the case of the most frequent fail-ure,  namely  the  phase  to  earth  fault,  the  duration  of  the  disturbance,  the  number  of the affected consumers, the work load for the operators, the voltage and current stresses  for  the  network  assets  and  the  extent  of  the  damage  into  a  double  earth  fault depend on the method of neutral grounding</p>
<p>The  selection  of  the  most  efficient  neutral  grounding  method  depends  on  the  type  of  lines  (overhead  or  cable),  the  line  to  ground  capacitance,  the  size  of  the  network and the fault currents<br />
Types:</p>
<ol>
<li>Resonant Grounding</li>

<h3 id="451-mv-networks"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#451-mv-networks"></a> 4.5.1 MV Networks</h3>
<p>In MV networks the digital protection relays have been introduced in the majority of  substations  and  distribution  terminals  of  central  Europe.  It  is  common  now  to  apply  combined  devices  covering  several  protection  and  control  functions</p>
<p>The combined devices are designed with a basic core serving the common system functions  like  the  memory  management,  the  permanent  check  of  the  analogue  and  binary input signals, the display and setting functions, etc.</p>
<p>The  overcurrent  protection  provides  three  various  elements  for  the  three  phase  currents and the ground current.</p>
<p>The  reverse  interlocking  principle  is  based  on  the  following:  If  the  fault  is  located behind the feeder protection in the network direction- 定向电流保护</p>
<p>The directional overcurrent protection is applied in networks where the pro-tection  coordination  depends  on  both  the  magnitude  of  the  short  circuit  current  and the direction of the power flow to the fault location</p>
<ul>
<li>电压保护</li>
</ul>
<p>The  voltage  protection  has  the  task  to  protect  electrical  equipment  against  under-  and  over-voltages.</p>
<ul>
<li>负序保护</li>
</ul>
<p>The  negative  sequence  protection  detects  unbalanced  loads  in  the  network.</p>
<ul>
<li>频率保护</li>
</ul>
<p>The frequency protection detects abnormally high and low frequencies in the network  or  in  electric  machines.</p>
<ul>
<li>热过载保护</li>
</ul>
<p>The thermal overload protection is designed to prevent thermal overloads and subsequent  damaging  of  the  protected  assets.</p>
<ul>
<li>电机保护</li>
</ul>
<p>The motor protection contains a set of functions like the motor starting protec-tion, a restart inhibit and a load jam protection.</p>
<ul>
<li>接地故障保护</li>
</ul>
<p>The ground fault protection has to be designed in accordance with the neutral grounding  method  applied  in  the  network.</p>
<p>The typical characteristic of intermittent ground faults is that they disappear autonomously  only  to  strike  again  after  some  time.  This  mainly  can  happen  in  cables due to aged insulation or in cable joints caused by water ingress</p>
<p>Therefore,  the  intermittent  ground  fault  protection  operates  in  the  following  way:  The  intermittent  ground  fault  impulses  are  detected  and  their  duration is recorded and accumulated.</p>
<ul>
<li>断路器故障保护</li>
</ul>
<p>The  breaker  failure  protection  monitors  the  proper  tripping  of  the  relevant  circuit  breaker.</p>
<ul>
<li>自动重合闸</li>
</ul>
<p>The  automatic  reclosing  function  is  mainly  used  in  networks  with  overhead  lines.</p>
<ul>
<li>同步功能</li>
</ul>
<p>The synchronization function provides the synchronization check before con-necting 2 sections of a network, for example a feeder and a busbar.</p>
<ul>
<li>故障定位器</li>
</ul>
<p>The  fault  locator  is  a  supplement  to  the  protection  functions  and  calculates  the distance to the fault.</p>
<p>Advanced protection devices also provide fault or disturbance records,</p>
<p>Additionally,  disturbance  reports  may  present  the  sequence  of  pickup,  trip  and reset events in the form of an event log</p>

The definition of the <em>power quality</em> is based on the three pillars:</p>
<ul>
<li>reliability of supply,</li>
<li>voltage quality and</li>
<li>service quality</li>
</ul>
<p>The  reliability  of  supply  is  verified  by  statistical  analyses  of  such  indices  as  the  frequency  of  supply  interruptions,  the  average  time  of  supply  interruptions  or  the  energy not delivered on time.</p>
<p>The  voltage  quality  is  affected  by  the  technical  parameters  of  the  network  (like short circuit power or network impedance), the characteristics of the network assets  and,  especially,  by  the  technical  processes  and  parameters  of  the  network  users</p>
<p>The demand processes of the network users may impact the voltage quality on all voltage lev-els.</p>
<p>The  damping  of  the  voltage  quality  disturbances  depends  on  the  technical  parameters of the network and its assets: The lower the impedance, the higher the damping</p>
<p>Fast voltage sags and flicker can be compensated by applying dynamic voltage restorers  which  perform  an  extremely  fast  in-feed  of  reactive  power  to  stabilize  the voltage.</p>
<p>The service quality expresses the quality of the relationship between the elec-tric power supply companies and the consumers.</p>

<p>The  Distribution  Control  Centre  (DCC)  performs  the  core  of  the  process  man-agement in distribution</p>
<p>Advanced DCCs present on screen the network topology, measurements, meter values, event messages in schemes, diagrams, profiles, tables and reports<br />
he management of the electricity distribution is focused on two basic systems:</p>
<ul>
<li>SCADA—supervisory control and data acquisition,</li>
<li>GDOF—general decision and optimization functions.</li>
</ul>
<p>The SCADA system performs the functions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Alarms in case of critical loading, disturbances of the voltage quality and faults,</li>
<li>Acquisition and processing of measurements and meter values,</li>
<li>Switch commands and further control (e.g. transformer tap changing),</li>
<li>Monitoring of the network topology,</li>
<li>Evaluation and archiving of the results of the performed application functions.</li>
</ul>
<p>The GDOF system is more concentrated on the power balancing functions which have a strong impact on the network operations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Load and local generation prediction,</li>
<li>Load control,</li>
<li>Optimization of the purchase and import of electric energy,</li>
<li>Condition simulations.</li>
</ul>
<p>The  network  operator  is  able  to  estimate  the  current  network  situation  by  an  appropriate visualization on the screens.<br />
The following functions are performed in this way:</p>

<h3 id="471-distributed-generation-and-new-types-of-load"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#471-distributed-generation-and-new-types-of-load"></a> 4.7.1 Distributed Generation and New Types of Load</h3>
<p>分布式发电和新型负载</p>
<p>The  new  challenges  for  distribution  network  operation  are  caused  by  global  tar-gets to reduce the CO2 emissions, to increase the share of renewable energy in the energy balance and to increase the energy efficiency</p>
<ul>
<li>DER: distributed energy resources 分布式能源</li>
</ul>
<p>A  significant  part  of  the  renewable  energy  will  feed  into  the  distribution  net-works  from  a  large  amount  of  small  sized  distributed  energy  resources  (DER).</p>
<p>The connection of DER in the LV and MV networks, however, may cause bi-di-rectional load flows between the LV, MV and HV networks.</p>
<p>If the load is lower than the generation, bottom–up (reverse) power flows will occur. And, because the meteor-ological conditions which directly affect generation levels are volatile, the load—gen-eration  balance  can  change  multiple  times  during  the  day.  Consequently,  the  power  flow becomes volatile and changes its direction multiple times during the day as well.</p>
<p>The  achievement  of  the  energy  efficiency  targets  will  also  be  supported  by  a  paradigm  change  regarding  the  heating  systems  for  households,  small  enterprises  and  public  buildings.</p>
<h3 id="472-impact-on-power-quality"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#472-impact-on-power-quality"></a> 4.7.2 Impact on Power Quality</h3>
<p>Due to the significant shares of DER, especially volatile energy sources and the appearance  of  new  loads  like  e-mobiles,  extreme  situations  may  occur  which  may cause short-term over-stressing of the network assets and of devices on the consumer side</p>
<p>Great challenges are seen in the reverse interferences of the new network users regarding the voltage quality:<br />
Great challenges are seen in the reverse interferences of the new network users regarding the voltage quality:</p>
<ul>
<li>Over-voltages through the connection of generators,</li>
<li>Under-voltages through powerful simultaneous loads,</li>
<li>Flicker (闪烁，飘忽不定) by wind power and photovoltaic plants,</li>
<li>Harmonic distortions generated by the power electronic converters of wind power and photovoltaic plants and by the charging units for e-mobiles.</li>
</ul>
<p>In  conclusion,  the  considerations  regarding  the  impact  of  new  users  of  distri-bution  networks  clearly  demonstrates  that  distribution  network  operations  will  becomes  more  complex  and  will  need  more  intelligent  coordination,  control  and  supervision in the sense of Smart Grids</p>

<p>The application of advanced power automation technology helps to increase the system observability, to provide guidance for the dispatchers and to automatically perform  the  proper  countermeasures  in  emergency  situations.</p>
<ul>
<li>Congestion management 堵塞管理</li>
</ul>
<p>Congestions may occur within a short time as a result of unforeseen outages of power stations or network assets or due to significant deviations from the regis-tered schedules that are larger than expected.</p>
<h2 id="51-the-root-causes-of-large-blackouts-and-the-lessons-learned"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#51-the-root-causes-of-large-blackouts-and-the-lessons-learned"></a> 5.1 The Root Causes of Large Blackouts and the Lessons Learned</h2>
<p>Power system operation includes the harmonious co-ordination of many processes in  a  large  cybernetic  system  composed  of  millions  of  components  of  equipment.  The main challenges are:<br />
Challenges of Power system operation:</p>
<ol>
<li>Balanced interplay of transmission capabilities, electricity demand and power generation,</li>
<li>Coordinated protection, control and communication functions supporting a flexible, real-time adaptation of the system conditions to actual situations.</li>
</ol>
<p>Voltage collapse can occur if the reactive power demand of the loads rises sig-nificantly due to voltage reduction in the grid. This mainly applies to motor-driven loads.</p>
<p>SCADA systems and communication links have to be secure under all circum-stances and have to be engineered so that they are uninterruptable,<br />
The lessons learned from this event are:</p>
<ul>
<li>SCADA systems and communication links have to be secure under all circumstances and have to be engineered so that they are uninterruptable,</li>
<li>Appropriate guidance for dispatchers accompanied by automatic network congestion management have to be performed if the transmission network is weakened for hours at a time,</li>
<li>The protection parameters should be adapted to the network conditions</li>
</ul>
<p>The  time  synchronization  via  satellite  of  all  intelligent  electronic  devices  (IEDs) for protection and control in the power system is now a strong request</p>
<p>Each  operation  requires  a  network  security  calculation  in  advance  of  taking  action<br />
In conclusion it should be stated:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each operation requires a network security calculation in advance of taking action,</li>
<li>Operations that bring the system into a N-1 unsecure situation should be strictly avoided,</li>
<li>The settings of the protection have to be archived and approved regularly in accordance with the substation documentation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Again  the  requirement  for  better  observability  of  the  transmission  network  comes  up.  Furthermore,  the  N-1  criterion  has  to  include  busbar  faults  and  also  consider the connected power generation</p>
<h2 id="52-control-areas-and-system-services"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#52-control-areas-and-system-services"></a> 5.2 Control Areas and System Services</h2>
<ul>
<li>TSO: transmission system operators</li>
<li>DNO: Distribution network operators</li>
</ul>
<p>As  operators  of  the  transmission  system,  the TSOs  are  responsible  for  the  secure  and  reliable  operation  of  the  electricity  network  in  their  respective  control  area,  and  for  interconnections  with  other  electricity  networks.</p>
<p>The  TSOs  are  obliged  by  law  to  operate  their  control  area  in  a  manner  which  assures the most secure, economical and environmentally sound network-dependent supply of electric power in the public interest</p>
<p>TSO (输送系统的操作者) 有责任以最安全、经济和环保的电力供应方式经营其控制区域，包括：</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Secure operation</em> of the transmission network ensuring the N-1 criterion at all times.</li>
<li>Management of the <em>balance of generation and load</em> at all times, provision of the interface to the liberalized electricity markets and carrying out the basic physical work necessary for the commercial power transfers.</li>
<li>Control of the <em>import/export of electric power</em> between the underlying networks and the neighboring control areas.</li>
</ol>
<p>With  regard  to  maintaining  the  proper  operation  of  the  control  area,  the  TSOs    provide  system  services  to  network  users  that  decisively  determine  the  quality  of  the electricity supply.<br />
The service to network users:</p>
<ul>
<li>Power system management,</li>
<li>Frequency control,</li>
<li>Voltage control,</li>
<li>Restoration of supply.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="521-power-system-management"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#521-power-system-management"></a> 5.2.1 Power System Management</h3>
<p>The  power  system  management  at  the  transmission  level  involves  two  aspects,  namely  the  operational  planning  and  execution  of  the  network  related  tasks  and  the generation–load balancing<br />
The  power  system  management  at  the  transmission  level  involves:</p>
<ol>
<li>the  operational  planning  and  execution  of  the  network  related  tasks</li>
<li>the generation-load balancing</li>
</ol>
<p>First, the top priorities of the network related tasks are:<br />
First, the top priorities of the network related tasks are:</p>
<ul>
<li>the <em>supervision and control</em> of the network topology including monitoring the bandwidths of voltages and power flows,</li>
<li>the <em>assurance</em> of the network N-1 security,</li>
<li>the recognition of <em>emergency</em> situations and the initiation of <em>congestion management</em>,</li>
<li>the requesting and execution of <em>switching operations</em>,</li>
<li>the <em>voltage/reactive power and power/frequency control</em> operations and the commissioning and maintenance of all the network assets, including the requisite facilities for metering and pricing regarding the horizontal energy exchange between the transmission system operators and the vertical energy exchange relating to the connected sub-transmission networks.</li>
</ul>
<p>Secondly,  the  power  system  management  includes  the  generation  and  load  bal-ancing.  This  involves  the  operational  implementation  of  the  agreed  upon  power  exchange  based  on  the  schedules  of  the  “Balancing  Groups”  and  the  generation  schedules  for  power  stations,  also  keeping  in  mind  the  requirements  for  reserve  power provisions.<br />
The control area consists of an arbitrary number of balancing groups<br />
containing:</p>
<ul>
<li>power injection nodes (usually metering points for the generating units of power stations) and</li>
<li>withdrawal nodes reflecting the demand.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>BGM (Balancing group managers)</em></p>
<p>The energy balance of the control area is subject to the responsibility of a number of balancing group managers (BGM).</p>
<p>In commercial and administrative terms, the BGM has the responsibility to</p>
<ul>
<li>inform in a timely manner the responsible system operators about injection and withdrawal points assigned to his balancing group,</li>
<li>aggregate the electrical energy exchanges in such a way that only one schedule is exchanged between two balancing groups,</li>
<li>deliver day-ahead schedules between 2 and 4 p.m. to the TSO. The schedules contain 96 values of the average power within each 1/4 h of the following day.</li>
</ul>
<p>n conclusion, the significant power system management functions include the load  and  the  renewable  generation  predictions  for  the  control  area,  the  manag-ing  of  the  interrelations  with  the  electricity  markets  to  cover  the  load  schedule,  the  congestion  forecasting  and  management,  the  observation  of  the  instantaneous  deployment  of  the  power  stations,  and  the  co-ordination  or  utilization  of  system  services</p>
<h3 id="522-frequency-control"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#522-frequency-control"></a> 5.2.2 Frequency Control</h3>
<p>In  an  electric  power  system,  power  generation  must  be  constantly  adjusted  to   follow the demand. Changes in demand or power station disturbances impair this balance and cause a deviation of the system frequency.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the TSOs have an obligation to permanently main-tain  sufficient  control  power  within  three  categories,  the  time  characteristics</p>
<ul>
<li>Primary control (or reserve) power</li>
<li>Secondary control (or reserve) power</li>
<li>Tertiary control power or Minutes reserve</li>
</ul>
<p>These three categories have different origins, parameters and targets of application.</p>
<ul>
<li>The purpose of the primary control is the assurance of the frequency control in emergency situations after the unplanned outages of important power plants.</li>
<li>The secondary control power may be positive or negative. Both kinds of secondary power have to be contracted in parallel</li>
<li>The TSOs shall deploy minutes reserve power in the event of large imbalances between generation and consumption and/or for the restoration of a sufficient secondary control band.</li>
</ul>
<p>The  secondary  control  power  may  be  positive  or  negative.  Both  kinds  of  sec-ondary power have to be contracted in parallel</p>
<p>The TSOs shall deploy minutes reserve power in the event of large imbalances between generation and consumption and/or for the restoration of a sufficient sec-ondary  control  band.</p>
<h3 id="523-voltage-control"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#523-voltage-control"></a> 5.2.3 Voltage Control</h3>
<p>Voltage  control  forms  part  of  the  measures  for  provision  of  a  secure  supply,  for  which the network operators at all levels of the power system (transmission system operators  TSO  and  distribution  network  operators  DNO)  bear  responsibility.</p>
<p>The TSO and DNO shall bear responsibility for balanced reactive power man-agement  in  his  network  installations,  including  the  demand  of  the  connection  users.</p>
<h3 id="524-restoration-of-supply"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#524-restoration-of-supply"></a> 5.2.4 Restoration of Supply</h3>
<p>The  TSO  is  responsible  for  reliable  system  operation  and  its  prompt  restoration  following large-scale failures and to draw up appropriate plans for preventive and operational  measures,  with  due  respect  to  the  respective  system  infrastructure,  in  conjunction  with  adjacent  TSOs  or  with  subordinated  DNOs  and  power  station  operators</p>
<p>According to the measures required, the providers  must  take  technical  measures  for  the  restoration  of  supply  and  demon-strate the efficiency of their facilities to the TSO.</p>
<h3 id="525-generation-scheduling-merit-order-principle"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#525-generation-scheduling-merit-order-principle"></a> 5.2.5 Generation Scheduling: Merit Order Principle</h3>
<p>Based on the schedules delivered by the balance group managers, each afternoon the TSO completes the day ahead load schedule for the control area.</p>
<p>A significant part  of  the  load  is  normally  covered  by  contracted  electricity  delivery  (for  exam-ple  in  the  industrial  sector).  Furthermore,  the  forecasts  of  the  balancing  group  “Renewable Energy” are known.</p>
<h3 id="526-system-service-provision-by-distributed-energy-resources"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#526-system-service-provision-by-distributed-energy-resources"></a> 5.2.6 System Service Provision by Distributed Energy Resources</h3>
<p>The  distributed  energy  resources  (DER)  are  mainly  based  on  renewable  energy  sources RES (wind, solar, biofuel, hydro) and on cogeneration of heat and power plants  (CHP).</p>
<p>nd the generated power of the DER can exceed the weak load. This requires innovative approaches to integrate DER into the sustain-able power system operation. The contribution of DER to the provision of system services will become mandatory.</p>
<p>Today the TSOs are obliged to manage and operate the electric power transmis-sion networks, and to do so they rely on system service procurement from the free market.</p>
<ul>
<li>VPP 虚拟电厂</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, the provision of system services by DER requires technical solutions in  the  sense  of  a  coordinated  operation  of  DER,  storage  and  controllable  loads  (Demand  Side  Management—DSM)  within  virtual  power  plants  (VPP).  The  vir-tual  power  plant  shall  be  able  to  provide  system  services  in  the  same  way  as  the  traditional power plants.</p>
<p>the system services provided by the DNO in their networks are limited to voltage stability, the network operation as a part of the system management and the restoration of supply.</p>
<p>the VPPs  will  be  able  to  support  the  frequency  control  by  offer-ing control power to the TSO</p>
<p>DSI consists of DSM (Demand Side Management)—the active control of loads and DSR (Demand Side Response)—the influence on the demand by dynamic tariffs.</p>
<p>DSM  can  provide  positive  control  power  by  switching-off  the  load  for  a  cer-tain time.</p>
<p>DSR  is  not  actively  controllable  and  therefore  it  is  not  suitable  for  the  control  power market</p>
<p>Finally,  fuel  driven  power  plants  and  storage  units  are  completely  controllable  and may provide all kinds of system services.</p>
<p>Consequently,  the  fuel  driven  power  plants  can  participate  in  both  markets  at  the  same time—for energy and for reserve power</p>
<p>For  all  kinds  of  CHP—fossil  fuel  and  RES—a  thermal  storage  is  the  key  to  an  electrical  driven  operation.</p>
<p>A  thermal  storage  allows  an  active  storage  man-agement  and  therefore  thee  CHP  plant  is  able  to  produce  heat  in  advance  to  fill  the storage while electrical power could be generate following a schedule. Additionally, thermal storages have much lower investment and operational costs  than  electrical  storage  plants.</p>
<p>VPPs may play a significant role in supporting the quality of supply regarding the voltage quality and the reliability</p>

<p>As  a  result  of  the  liberalized  energy  markets  and  the  extremely  fast  growth  of  vola-tile  renewable  energy  production  the  power  flows  through  the  networks  and  the  interconnection nodes between the control areas has become strongly volatile</p>

<p>In accordance with the growing contribution of volatile RES in the power balance the prediction of the RES injections will become more and more important for the network security<br />
Two developing trends have to be considered:</p>
<ul>
<li>The further growth of the installed power of <em>photovoltaic plants and smaller wind power parks</em> will affect the distribution and sub-transmission network operations.</li>
<li>The number of <em>large scale wind parks</em> with installed power of some 100 MW that are erected in <em>onshore and offshore locations</em> and have direct access to the transmission network will continue to increase.</li>
</ul>
<p>Consequently, the further development of prediction systems has to be focused on:</p>
<ol>
<li>The improvement of the <em>prediction accuracy</em>,</li>
<li>The introduction of prediction methods in the <em>distribution level</em>,</li>
<li>The <em>extended data exchange</em> between the transmission and distribution networks</li>
</ol>
<p>Network  security  will  require  more  interaction  between  the  TSO  and  the  DNOs  because of the volatility of the power flows at the coupling nodes between the net-work levels.</p>
<p>Prediction  tools  have  been  developed  and  implemented  since  2000  especially  for the wind power production within the control area of the TSO.</p>
<p>The  security  of  the  power  system  operation  requires  the  parallel  execution  of  the day-ahead predictions and the short-term predictions to be prepared in advance for possible congestions</p>
<p>Significant  improvements  of  the  prediction  quality  are  achievable  if  intelligent  weighting methods with regard to the weather situation are applied.<br />
#DACF<br />
<strong>Day-Ahead Congestion Forecast (DACF) in the Interconnected Transmission System</strong></p>
<p>Within the interconnected transmission network in Continental Europe the DACF approach  was  implemented  to  estimate  critical  network  conditions  in  advance.  This  approach  realizes  the  prediction  of  the  operation  conditions  for  the  whole  power system 2 days in advance (2DCF) and for the current “intra-day” (IDCF).<br />
Prediction operation:</p>
<ul>
<li>The intra-day predictions use load and generation data from actual snapshots.</li>
<li>At the moment of the predictions for d + 2, the schedules for the power plants are still not available.</li>
<li>Each TSO prepares for 6 time points (Germany-24) of the day-ahead data sets including the loads and injections of all network nodes.</li>
<li>In the next step, the snapshot of the network conditions of the reference time points are taken from the archive.</li>
<li>The power producers provide the predicted power injection schedules to the TSO taking into account the load schedule.</li>
<li>To balance the load and generation, the loads in all nodes will be adapted in proportion to compensate the deviations between the reference and the predicted power plant schedules</li>
<li>The predicted data sets of all TSOs and the overall data set for the interconnected system are available for all network operators on a common server.</li>
</ul>
<p>The  predicted  data  sets  of  all  TSOs  and  the  overall  data  set  for  the  intercon-nected  system  are  available  for  all  network  operators  on  a  common  server.<br />
<strong>The Need for Network Level Overlapping Congestion Forecasts</strong></p>
<p>The  growing  share  of  DER  feeding  into  the  distribution  networks  means  that  the  distribution  networks  may  be  stressed  above  their  capability  limits</p>
<p>Currently,  though,  the  application  of  congestion  forecast  tools is still not common in distribution networks.</p>
<p>However, the prediction of the of the distribution network conditions will play an increasingly important role for the general power system operation. The volatile bi-directional  load  flows  at  the  coupling  nodes  between  the  network  levels  has  a  growing impact on the security of the whole power system.</p>
<p>It is an urgent need that the network operators on the different levels cooperate in the prediction of RES power injections and the prediction of congestion condi-tions in a common way</p>
<p>Steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>accurate predictions of the load and the power injections have to be performed for the local distribution networks at the MV level</li>
<li>the predicted data of the several connected nodes has to be transferred to the planned topology of the MV network.</li>
<li>the predicted network conditions of the HV sub-transmission networks create the power flow conditions at the coupling nodes with the transmission network at the EHV level.</li>
</ol>
<p>The power flow estimations serve as the inputs for the network condition fore-casts at the upper network level which is based on the planned topology, the pre-dicted loads and power injections.</p>
<p>5.3.2.4  The Cellular Approach for Predictions, Balancing and Schedule Management<br />
The weakness of the current balancing and prediction processes described in the previous chapters consists of the following aspects:</p>
<ol>
<li>The suppliers are mostly the balance group managers for the withdrawal nodes.</li>
<li>The reference day principle used for the DACF congestion forecasts is also of low accuracy. The TSOs increasingly need the coupling node oriented forecasts for the secure system operation within their control area.</li>
<li>The TSO is responsible for balancing all of installed RES in its control area.</li>
<li>The prediction of the power injections from RES is based on the general weather forecasts for larger regions. However, the weather conditions may differ greatly within one region. The prediction accuracy can be significantly improved if the predictions for the RES power injections are performed for smaller territori</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>SSC: Smart Supply Cells 智能供应细胞</li>
</ul>
<p>The SSCs sup-port the TSO to reduce the complexity of power system operation self-balancing, provide  the  cellular  balancing  group  responsibility  and  offer  system  services</p>
<p>An SSC may cover one or more distribution networks containing DER that are fully involved in the balancing processes. They are obliged to predict and deliver their  individual  schedules.</p>

</ul>
<p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/YangSuoly/Images/Prelim/202412011142563.png" alt="Pasted image 20241020100635" /></p>
<p>it  will  become  more  and  more  important  for  the  general  secu-rity  of  network  operations  to  observe  the  selectivity  of  the  protection  schemes.  An  important  instrument  for  the  prevention  of  disturbance  enlargements  is  the  “Protection Security Assessment” (PSA),</p>
<ol>
<li>First of all, the PSA method requires a detailed data base of all protection schemes, characteristics and settings of the network.</li>
<li>Secondly, a data base for condition simulations has to be established containing
<ul>
<li>the load and generation conditions,</li>
<li>the possible network topology changes and</li>
<li>fault characteristics, disturbance records, fault probabilities</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Based  on  the  described  data  the  assessment  tool  may  provide  a  stepwise  off-line  event  simulation  including  all  protection  devices,  all  possible  faults  and  ground  resistances at various locations along the network considering also the fault proba-bilities and breaker failure conditions<br />
If large networks with tens of thousands of protection devices have to be approved, the results should be presented separately in three levels:</p>
<ol>
<li>the main protection schemes,</li>
<li>the back-up protection schemes,</li>
<li>the main and back-up protection schemes together</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Adaptive Protection</strong></p>
<p>In  the  past,  the  protection  schemes  were  designed  to  protect  the  assigned  asset  against damages caused by faults by tripping the faulted network elements rapidly and  ensuring  in  the  same  way  the  secure  continuation  of  the  network  operations.  The only criterion for activities was the detection of faults that exceeded the pickup settings.</p>
<p>Now,  however,  due  to  the  quickly  changing  network  conditions  the  protection  behaviour has to become smarter and provide more flexibility.</p>
<p>The  target  of  this  new  role  is  that  the  protection  automatically  recognizes  that  the actual settings and characteristics may cause over or under function.<br />
<strong>System Protection</strong></p>
<p>In  addition  to  the  traditional  tasks  of  the  rapid,  secure  and  selective  fault  elimi-nation,  the  protection  schemes  may  perform  system  protection  tasks  ensuring  the  power  system  stability  in  emergency  situations  and  avoiding  the  enlargement  of  disturbances into blackouts</p>

<p>Wide  area  monitoring  systems  (WAM)  are  based  on  accurate  measurements  of  voltages,  phase  angles,  currents,  frequency  and  frequency  sags  and  reactive  and  active  power  flows  by  phasor  measurement  units  (PMU)  installed  in  selected  nodes  of  the  network  system.</p>
<p>The  results  of  the  phasor  measurement  analysis  by  the  data  concentrator  provide:<br />
The results of the phasor measurement analysis by the data concentrator provide:</p>
<ul>
<li>a real-time state estimation and stability observation of the networks,</li>
<li>the detection of power oscillations, their analysis and the generation of appropriate countermeasures,</li>
<li>the dynamic load flow control,</li>
<li>improved accuracy of the analysis of faults and the fault location,</li>
<li>the monitoring of asset condition for their higher utilization,</li>
<li>detection of islanded networks through frequency comparison.</li>
</ul>
<p>The  interactive  user  interface  of  the  data  concentrator  has  to  be  designed  to    provide  an  optimum  support  to  the  dispatchers.<br />
The following design rules are common in the advanced WAM systems of different vendors:</p>
<ul>
<li>fast identification of the system conditions (okay, critical, alarm),</li>
<li>free selection of the desired measurement records or phasor diagrams in a configuration field,</li>
<li>setting of thresholds to be observed,</li>
<li>simple shift between on-line and off-line mode for the interactive analysis of events,</li>
<li>geographical presentation of the network with the allocation of PMUs allowing the fast location of areas with stability problems,</li>
<li>gateways for data export and import to allow the cooperation with other assessment tools.</li>

<h3 id="535-steady-state-and-dynamic-security-assessment"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#535-steady-state-and-dynamic-security-assessment"></a> 5.3.5 Steady State and Dynamic Security Assessment</h3>
<p>Security calculations today are mostly performed as load flow contingency calcu-lations (sequence of N-1 violations using the current network conditions). As a result the operator is getting an overview of the situations in which overloads of equipment and congestions may occur. All decision making is the responsibility of the operator.</p>
<p>Both  the  steady  state  assessment  (SSA)  and the dynamic security assessment (DSA) methods have to be enhanced and intro-duced as a combined method to provide better support to the network dispatcher</p>
<p>A security assessment could provide the quantitative request of load reduction. For  example,  lowering  the  pump  storage  load  by  50%  would  not  affect  the  con-sumers.</p>
<p>The advanced steady state security assessment has to be executed on-line. It consists of the following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>on-line performance of subsequent N-1 <em>contingency load flow</em> calculations,</li>
<li>consideration of the <em>volatility of power injections</em> with a time horizon of minimum 1 h,</li>
<li>indication of possible <em>congestions and emergency</em> situations,</li>
<li>start of an <em>optimized load flow calculation</em> for the indicated N-1 violation conditions taking into account the available control opportunities (e.g. change of grid topology, reactive power control etc.),</li>
<li>recognizing the <em>differences</em> to the current operation conditions,</li>
<li>creation of <em>recommendations</em> for how to shift the system to secure N-1 conditions.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Dynamic security assessment (DSA)</strong></p>
<p>he  dynamic  security  assessment  is  based  on  advanced  power  system  simula-tion  methods.  In  many  cases  it  has  been  demonstrated  that  the  simulation  deliv-ers a highly accurate depiction when compared with the recorded disturbances</p>
<p>This  example  demonstrates  that  the  dynamic  system  behavior  is  accurately  predictable using simulation tools. Furthermore, the countermeasures for stability enhancement may also be simulated and their efficiency may be approved.<br />
The dynamic investigation of the power system has to consider the three major aspects of stability disturbances:</p>
<ul>
<li>the voltage stability (avoidance of voltage collapse according to Sect. 5.1.1.)</li>
<li>the small signal stability (when the system is near to the initiation of un-damped power swings according to the eigenvalue method, or if the voltage angle difference between the neighboring nodes is close to 90°),</li>
<li>the transient stability reflecting the damping of power oscillations after faults.</li>
</ul>

<p>The 1st priority of the dynamic security assessment is to provide detailed infor-mation of the power system stability and to create alarms in critical situations.</p>
<p>For  such  expert  systems  a  broad  knowledge  data  base  of  the  dynamic  system  behavior has to be developed. The neural network is able to select the appropriate countermeasures for improving a recognized critical situation using the knowledge data base</p>

<p>The  maximum  loading  of  transmission  lines  is  limited  by  the  temperature  of  the  conductors  which  is  influenced  by  the  weather  conditions  and  the  current  flow.</p>
<p>However, the worst case conditions are very rarely valid. In practice, the tradi-tional thermal overload protection avoids the full utilization of the physical trans-port capability of the transmission lines. In the case of lower temperature or higher wind speed, an increase of the line loading will be possible without exceeding the thermal thresholds</p>
<h2 id="54-conclusions"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#54-conclusions"></a> 5.4 Conclusions</h2>
<p>The  new  conditions  of  network  operation  with  volatile  power  injections  lead  to  a  higher loading of the network assets and the growing danger of stability violations.<br />
Maintaining the high level of reliability has to be performed in two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>network enhancement</em> by advanced primary technologies,</li>
<li>improved monitoring and intelligent <em>congestion management</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The  new  tasks  of  network  planning  are  directed  at  defining  the  optimum  ratio  between both approaches.</p>
<ul>
<li>Intelligent congestion management</li>
</ul>
<p>The  intelligent  congestion  management  is  based  on  the  set  of  the  above  described  methods  and  instruments  allowing  better  observation  of  the  network  conditions,  more  efficient  utilization  of  the  installed  assets  and  adaptation  of  the  network control/automation/protection according to these conditions.<br />
However, the described methods cannot stand alone. It is necessary to manage their mutual interaction in order to gain optimum efficiency and operational benefits.</p>
<ul>
<li>monitoring and communication of the <em>weather conditions</em> to the control center,</li>
<li>integration into the <em>state estimation</em> procedures of the control center,</li>
<li>approval by the <em>dynamic security assessment</em> and protection security assessment to avoid, for example, voltage collapse or stability problems and the</li>
<li>dynamic adaptation of the <em>thermal overload protection</em> characteristics.</li>
</ul>
<p>Intelligent  congestion  management  is  requested  to  ensure  the  efficiency  of  the  transmission  network  enhancement  and  the stability of the entire interconnected transmission system.</p>
<p>The intelligent congestion management supplements the network extension by  using  primary  assets.</p>

<h2 id="61-the-relationship-between-smart-grids-and-smart-markets-in-distribution-systems"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#61-the-relationship-between-smart-grids-and-smart-markets-in-distribution-systems"></a> 6.1 The Relationship Between Smart Grids and Smart Markets in Distribution Systems</h2>
<p>The coor-dination of all network users in the sense of the Smart Grid definition seems to be useful to ensure the economic feasibility, the reliability, the sustainability and the reduced ecological impact of the electricity supply processes.<br />
The question arises, how the optimum relationship can be found between:</p>
<ul>
<li>the network enhancement required to respond to the requested bidirectional power transfers with <em>extremely high variability</em>, and</li>
<li>the impact on the network users to <em>adapt their behaviour</em> to the available power transfer capacity</li>
</ul>
<p>However,  the  coordination  of  the  connected  consumers  and  the  distributed  energy  resources  (DER)  has  an  impact  on  the  market  processes.<br />
It will become necessary to approach such challenges like:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>balancing</em> the intermittent <em>power injections</em> of the DER with the <em>demand</em>,</li>
<li>monitoring and controlling the <em>voltage increase</em> at the connection points of DER,</li>
<li>observing the <em>loads</em>, especially the charging of electric cars to avoid any overloading of network equipment,</li>
<li>maintaining the <em>reliability</em> of supply at today’s high level despite the changing conditions.</li>
</ul>
<p>The  quality  of  supply  including  the  voltage  quality  and  the  reliability  may  be  maintained under the new conditions in two ways:<br />
The quality of supply (voltage quality and reliability):</p>
<ol>
<li>Extremely strong enhancement of the network to meet all possible, including very rare varieties, of load flows or</li>
<li>Smart interaction between grid operations and market activities concerning the producers and consumers.</li>
</ol>
<p>The  relationship  between  the  markets  and  the  distribution  network  operators  (DNO) is complex and diverse</p>
<p>Traditionally,  the  network  users  had  to  compensate  the  operational  expenses  (OPEX) including the return of investment (ROI) through the markets and, in  exchange,  the  DNO  offered  a  high  power  quality  consisting  of  three  compo-nents—voltage  quality,  reliability  of  supply  and  service  quality<br />
DNO offers a high power quality consisting of three components:</p>
<ul>
<li>voltage quality</li>
<li>reliability of supply</li>
<li>service quality</li>
</ul>
<p>the economy of the grid operation expenses will require the adaptation of loads or generation to the available network capacity in the environ-ment  of  volatile  power  in-feed  and  strong  simultaneous  demands.</p>
<p>he  stakeholders  of  the  markets  are  the  traders,  the  power  plants,  the  virtual  power  plants  (VPP—aggregating  and  coordinating  distributed  energy  resources,  switchable loads and storage), providers of electricity storage and the consumers.<br />
The establishment of Smart Grids in the distribution level has to include the following three pillars:</p>
<ol>
<li>配电自动化 <em>Distribution Automation</em>—Network automation and remote control to avoid over voltages or overloads and to <em>improve the reliability</em> by speeding up the supply recovery after fault induced trips （故障跳闸）,</li>
<li>智能聚合 <em>Smart Aggregation</em>—<em>Energy management</em> on the distribution level to coordinate the DERs, storage units and controllable loads for balancing and participation in markets for energy, ancillary and/or flexibility services and carbon certificates,</li>
<li>智能计量 <em>Smart Metering</em>—<em>Consumer involvement</em> in the electricity market as a motivation for higher energy efficiency via variable tariffs and the visualization of tariffs, demand and costs.</li>
</ol>

<p>The  main  tasks  of  the  distribution  network  automation  include  voltage  control,  power flow control, remote executed operations for changing the network topology and the improved fault elimination/restoration of supply.<br />
The traditional voltage quality control parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li>As a first priority, the algorithm of the voltage controller requires the voltage measurement at the MV busbars.</li>
<li>The second influencing parameter is the measured current</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>In  principle,  the  smart  meters  will  be  installed  at  the  connection  nodes  of  the  majority of network users to provide dynamic tariff systems<br />
<strong>Involvement of the Network Users into Voltage Control</strong></p>
<p>If  over-voltages  occur  which  are  caused  by  strong  power  injections  (mainly  from  photovoltaic  plants  at  noon),  the  voltage  may  be  decreased  by  an  increased  active  and/or  reactive  power  demand  near  to  the  power  injection  node.<br />
Ways to mitigate:</p>
<ol>
<li>Low tariffs are offered during midday on sunny days.</li>
<li>The DNO may install storage batteries at the affected nodes. They can be charged during high power injections and decrease the voltage in this way.</li>
<li>The DER, including storage batteries, may be operated with under excitation and demand reactive power.</li>
</ol>
<p>Contrarily,  if  it  is  necessary  to  increase  the  voltage  because  a  peak  load/low  generation  situation  occurs  with  under-voltage,  then  the  three  actions  should  be  reversed  to  control  the  load,  namely:  offering  higher  tariffs,  discharging  batteries  and DER operation with over excitation.</p>
<p>However,  all  of  these  methods  require  the  remote  reading  of  measurements,  status  indications  and  remote  control.  Communication  networks  have  to  be  intro-duced at the distribution level for the smart distribution network operation.</p>
<h3 id="622-opportunities-for-power-flow-control"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#622-opportunities-for-power-flow-control"></a> 6.2.2 Opportunities for Power Flow Control</h3>
<p>Overloading of network assets may occur bi-directionally in cases of:</p>
<ul>
<li>weak load/strong generation situations (e.g. on a sunny day at noon in a network with large scale connection of photovoltaic units) in the direction bottom up, or</li>
<li>peak load/weak generation situations (e.g. in evening when people come home from work and simultaneously cook, wash and charge the electric cars) in the direction top–down.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first priority of the power flow control requires the remote monitoring of the currents and/or the power flow measurements at the MV/LV transformer terminals. The  power  flow  control  may  also  be  executed  by  network  operations  and  market  activities</p>
<p>The market driven power flow control activities may be categorized as definite (hard)  and  probable  (soft)  methods.  The  definite  methods  are  based  on  special  contract or tariff conditions and consist of the:<br />
Reduction or increase of the power output of DER by using the reserve power mechanisms on the distribution level,</p>
<ul>
<li>Switch-off or increase of controllable loads like air conditioners in summer or heat pumps in winter, which are offered on the positive reserve power market,</li>
<li>Controlled discharging or charging of storage units, including the batteries of connected electric vehicles,</li>
<li>Switch-off of previously contracted load or generation in emergency situations.</li>
</ul>

<p>he fault location and elimination in MV networks is  traditionally  executed  manually  by  driving  along  the  faulted  feeder  and  check-ing  the  short  circuit  indicators  of  the  MV/LV  transformer  terminals</p>

<p>The connection of DER in MV distribution networks provides a significant impact on the protection behavior</p>
<p>6.2.4.3  Phasor Measurement in Distribution Networks<br />
The main application areas for PMUs (phasor measurement units，相量测量单元) are seen as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Central voltage controller in distribution networks,</li>
<li>Master power controller for the DER connection by power electronic converters,</li>
<li>Voltage quality monitoring,</li>
<li>Islanding detection,</li>
<li>Synchronism check for re-connection of islanded network parts,</li>
<li>Shaping awareness for system stability with the visualization of phasor measurements.</li>
</ul>

<p>The  enhancement  of  such  a  large  number  of  terminals  for  controllability  requires  a  significant  investment.  But,  is  it  economically  useful  to  enhance  all  transformer terminals?</p>
<p>in this sense, a new optimization task for the network planning appears by selecting:</p>
<ul>
<li>the terminals which require enhanced <em>voltage control</em>,</li>
<li>the terminals which require enhanced <em>power flow control</em>,</li>
<li>the terminals which provide the best benefit–cost ratio for <em>reliability improvement</em></li>
</ul>
<p>In  conclusion  it  can  be  stated  that  a  Smart  Grid  does  not  require  the  complete  introduction  of  new  technologies  in  all  network  parts.  However,  the  Smart  Grid  approach does require the economic intelligent weighting of the efficiency.</p>

<h3 id="631-basics-of-virtual-power-plants"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#631-basics-of-virtual-power-plants"></a> 6.3.1 Basics of Virtual Power Plants</h3>
<p>The growing shares of volatile renewable power in the annual electricity consump-tion  require  the  introduction  of  new  methods  to  compensate  for  fluctuations  and  prediction  errors</p>
<p>The main task of the VPP is directed to the electricity market and contains the following basic tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Forecasting, balancing and coordination of all <em>aggregated assets</em> like generators, storages and controllable loads including the highly volatile wind and photovoltaic generation,</li>
<li>Completion of the <em>day-ahead schedules</em> of the whole VPP and sale of the scheduled energy on the electricity market,</li>
<li>Online <em>monitoring</em> of the electric power production and <em>estimation</em> of schedule deviations,</li>
<li><em>Decision making in an optimization process</em> about the use of its own resources (control of the power generation and/or Demand Side Management DSM to adapt the controllable loads) for the compensation of fluctuations or for paying the charges for the use of external reserve power provided by the control area manager.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this sense, the VPP can provide the balancing services to the power produc-ers for significantly lower expenses than the single producers can</p>
<p>The optimization goal and mathematical target function is to maximize the benefit by using all possible market indications taking into account network fees and must run requirements due to heat or electric power:</p>
<ul>
<li>Electric energy day-ahead and intraday markets,</li>
<li>Reserve power markets,</li>
<li>Flexibility service provision to the DNO,</li>
<li>Fuel costs,</li>
<li>Charges for network use,</li>
<li>Heat energy market (by optimized operation of Cogeneration of Heat and Power (CHP) plants on the electric energy market and storage of heat energy which is not required in periods with high electricity prices),</li>
<li>CO2—Certificate trade</li>
</ul>
<p>The aim is to achieve benefits for each VPP component which a single asset could not  address  alone.  For  this,  the VPP  coordination  is  based  on  optimization  tools.</p>
<h3 id="632-demand-side-management-the-role-of-storage-and-controllable-loads"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#632-demand-side-management-the-role-of-storage-and-controllable-loads"></a> 6.3.2 Demand Side Management: The Role of Storage and Controllable Loads</h3>
<p>The  adaptation  of  the  demand  to  the  available  power  generation  will  gain  impor-tance  in  the  environment  of  fluctuating  power  generation.  The  demand  has  to  be  integrated  into  the  power  system  management  in  general.<br />
#DSI #DSM #DSR<br />
The Demand Side Integration (DSI) has two aspects:</p>
<ol>
<li>DSM—<em>Demand Side Management</em> is the active switching of load either on a contractual basis with the VPP provider or based on offers on the reserve power market if the offered switchable power corresponds with the requirements accordingly Table 5.1.</li>
<li>DSR—<em>Demand Side Response</em> is the impact on the consumer behavior by dynamic tariffs coupled with means to achieve consumer awareness regarding the changing tariffs, the current demand and the related costs. However, the DSR depends on the willingness of the consumers to shift intensive load into periods with low tariffs. The DSR outcome can be estimated by predictions only and cannot be applied to perform the VPP function.</li>
</ol>
<p>Electric storage capabilities will play a significant role in the Smart Grid envi-ronment. Electric storage providers can act on the electricity market by benefitting from  the  spread  of  electricity  prices  (charging  in  low  price  periods,  discharging  in high price periods) and on the markets for reserve power or flexibility services within a VPP.</p>
<p>On the other hand, during the weak load time the storage units are charged and the DSM  groups  are  switched  on.  These  actions  increase  the  demand  of  the  supply  area when the prices for electricity are low</p>

<h3 id="641-basics-of-the-digital-metering-technology"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#641-basics-of-the-digital-metering-technology"></a> 6.4.1 Basics of the Digital Metering Technology</h3>
<p>The digital technology was successfully introduced for protection and control and has  been  in  use  since  the  late  1980s</p>
<p>offering economic and technical benefits compared to the previous analogue elec-tronic  and  electro-mechanical  technologies.</p>
<p>A  Smart  Meter  is  mainly  an  electrical  meter  that  records  the  consumption  of  electric  energy  in  short  time  intervals  (from  minutes  to  one  hour)  and  then  com-municates  that  information  to  the  traders  for  monitoring  the  demand  profiles  and  for billing</p>
<p>Additional  important  features  include  voltage  quality  monitoring,  load  profile  recording,  gateway  to  home  automation  facilities  (for  energy  management)  and  security functions.<br />
With the introduction of smart meters the following objectives are often targeted:</p>
<ul>
<li>Significant <em>benefits</em> for market participants,</li>
<li>Market driven approach with the <em>integration of DER–RES</em>,</li>
<li><em>Energy savings and climate protection</em> by giving more real-time consumer feedback,</li>
<li><em>Limiting the peak power</em> of segments of the grid by enabling <em>Demand Side Response</em>,</li>
<li>Competition in the metering data collection service and customer care,</li>
<li>As fast as possible widespread distribution of intelligent measuring systems,</li>
<li>Acceptable cost-benefit ratio by <em>automating the metering processes</em>,</li>
<li>Smart Grid “Readiness”</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="642-dynamic-tariffs"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#642-dynamic-tariffs"></a> 6.4.2 Dynamic Tariffs</h3>
<p>The expectation regarding the introduction programs is that smart metering will  offer  a  number  of  potential  benefits  to  the  consumers,  traders  and  network  operators.<br />
These benefits concern both the commercial and the electricity supply processes, and provide:</p>
<ul>
<li>an end to estimated bills, which are a major source of complaints for many consumers,</li>
<li>a tool to help consumers better manage their energy use—stating that Smart Meters with an in-house display could provide up-to-date information about the actual electricity consumption and, in so doing, help people to manage their energy use and reduce their energy bills and carbon emissions</li>
</ul>
<p>In  the  future  such  averaging  mechanisms  to  create  the  tariff  cannot  support  the  above  mentioned  expectations  regarding  the  adaptation  of  the  demand  to  the  energy  availability.<br />
Dynamic tariffs will be based on the hourly changing energy<br />
prices:</p>
<ul>
<li>to compensate energy deficits by applying higher tariffs,</li>
<li>to utilize excesses of renewable energy by offering lower tariffs.</li>
</ul>

<p>In general, the introduction of dynamic tariffs in combination with home auto-mation  will  become  advantageous  if,  within  the  next  10–20  years,  all  consumers  obtain  home  automation  facilities  and  can  adapt  their  electricity  consumption  automatically in the same way as the best practice consumers did within the W2E project</p>
<h3 id="644-electric-vehicle-management"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#644-electric-vehicle-management"></a> 6.4.4 Electric Vehicle Management</h3>
<p>The question arises again: Is it necessary to enhance the network capabilities in a way that such simultaneous charging will become possible or it is more useful to introduce innovative methods for the electric vehicle management?</p>
<p>The  charging  stations  are  connected  via  com-munication  links  with  a  control  system—the  mobility  control  center  (MCC)<br />
The MCC receives information about</p>
<ul>
<li>the current electricity prices from the traders,</li>
<li>the current loading situations of the parts of the network that contain charging stations,</li>
<li>the appropriate charges for additional network use from the DNO</li>

<p>Traditionally,  the  local  distribution  networks  are  mostly  operated  without  remote  control  mechanisms  and  automation  functions.  The  distributed  energy  resources  (DER)  feed  in  the  maximum  possible  generation  corresponding  to  the  weather  conditions</p>
<p>The  introduction  of  the  three  pillars  of  distribution  is  aimed  at  improving  the  traditional  approaches  and  requires  a  deep  paradigm  change.  This  will  change  the role of the distribution system from a passive to an active one that takes more responsibility in the overall power system</p>
<p>In  the  future  the  distribution  will  have  the  important  role  of  keeping  the  local  balance between energy production and energy consumption.</p>
<p>Consequently, information and communication technologies (ICT) will play the key role to ensure the sustainable and reliable network operation in the context of an increasing share of DER and new types of consumers connected to the distribu-tion networks</p>

<p>Smart  Grids  are  regarded  as  the  pre-requisite  for  meeting  the  challenges  of  the  electricity  supply  of  the  twenty  first  century  with  its  significant  share  of  renewa-ble energy sources (RES) in the annual electricity consumption, most of which are volatile  and  dependent  on  the  weather  conditions</p>
<p>The  main  idea  of  Smart  Grids—namely,  the  intelligent  integration  of  all  their  users (see  Sect. 1.1)—is  currently  prevented  by  the  market  design  in  the  majority  of European countries that apply the “feed-in tariff” supporting scheme.</p>

<p>The  development  of  a  prospective  market  design  is  mandatory  to  meet  the  chal-lenges of the electricity supply of the twenty first century in an economic and sus-tainable way.</p>
<p>The following aspects are considered as the foundation of the prospective market in the electricity supply processes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Interaction of Smart Grid and Smart Market</li>
<li>Renewable power producers become active market players</li>
<li>More flexibility of the definite power production</li>
<li>Price growth for fossil electricity generation</li>
<li>Costs for renewable electricity generation will decline</li>
<li>Changed coverage of the load profile</li>
<li>Qualified schedule management based on the cellular approach</li>
<li>
<ol start="8">
<li>Tariffs based on dynamic electricity prices and network charges</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Motivation of the network operators</li>

<h3 id="721-the-overview-of-the-smart-services"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#721-the-overview-of-the-smart-services"></a> 7.2.1 The Overview of the Smart Services</h3>
<p>The  prospective  interaction  of  smart  network  operations  and  market  activities  require the establishment of new services in the area of information and communi-cation technologies</p>
<p>n  the  prospective  Smart  Supply  Cells,  data  from  meters  are  also  requested for the targets of the three pillars of Smart Distribution as the prerequi-site for the cellular balancing and securing the power quality</p>
<ul>
<li>The <em>DNO</em> needs metered and measured values for the load flow supervision and the voltage observation in critical nodes (digital meters are able to provide voltage measurements).</li>
<li>The <em>party</em> responsible for balancing needs the online provision of the balance between load and generation to control the schedules of the Smart Supply Cell and minimize the costs for schedule deviations.</li>
<li>The <em>VPP</em> needs the ¼ h meter values from the aggregated plants and controllable loads for an online schedule observation and to perform intra-day optimization decisions.</li>
<li>The <em>traders</em> need load profiles of their consumers to improve the scheduling by using predictions based on the correlation between the weather conditions and the demand profiles.</li>
<li>The <em>metering services</em> for other media (water, heat, gas) in a multi- utility may also be integrated into the operations of the service provider responsible for the cell.</li>
<li>The charging of e-mobiles needs special supervision and influencing methods in order to avoid a large number of simultaneous charges in a limited part of a network, which would create overloading stress</li>
</ul>

<p>However, all consumers have the opportunity to select their own meter service provider. A  complicated  chain  of  contracts  between  the  trader,  the  meter  service  provider, the network operator and the consumer has to be completed.</p>
<h3 id="723-data-communication-and-information-management"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#723-data-communication-and-information-management"></a> 7.2.3 Data Communication and Information Management</h3>
<p>The three pillars of Smart Distribution require the establishment of a communica-tion infrastructure in the distribution networks all the way down to the consumers connected  to  the  low  voltage  networks.</p>
<p>The communication provider rolls out the data communication network and the data  traffic  according  to  the  quality  attributes  for  the  Smart  Grid  and  the  Smart  Market.</p>
<p>The  information  provider  (or  data  access  manager)  receives  payments  accord-ing  to  the  volume  of  data  acquired  by  the  customers.</p>

<h3 id="811-functions-of-ict-standards"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#811-functions-of-ict-standards"></a> 8.1.1 Functions of ICT Standards</h3>
<p>The information exchange necessary to properly run Smart Grids has to cover all levels  of  the  electric  power  system  and  will  take  on  a  new  quality  compared  to  the  traditional  communication  methods.</p>
<p>he  immense  increase  in  the  volume  of  data  to  be  transferred  requires  the  application  of  advanced  information  and  com-munication  technologies  (ICT)  in  order  to  avoid  extremely  increased  engineering  efforts  and  to  ensure  consistency  and  security  of  the  data  transfer  from  level  to  level.<br />
he new standards have to cover the following main functions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Online data transfer through communication networks,</li>
<li>Consistent information management and data exchange between the data bases of various enterprise management systems,</li>
<li>Protection against data manipulations and to ensure information security.</li>
</ul>

<li>网络层</li>
<li>传输层</li>
<li>会话层</li>
<li>表示层</li>
<li>应用层</li>
</ul>
<p>The  exact  definition  of  all  layers  builds  the  communication  protocol.  Simple  communication  protocols  may  use  only  the  layers  1,  2  and  7.</p>
<p>The definition of uniform data models of the application layer is the mandatory pre-requisite of an efficient communication system for Smart Grids</p>
<p>First  of  all,  the  communication  has  to  penetrate  the  distribution  level  down  to  the  low  voltage  network  users  in  order  to  perform  the  three  pillars  of  Smart  Distribution,</p>
<p>The  most  efficient  communication  technologies  that can be applied depend on the local conditions and may be in different physical forms: copper cables, fiber optic cables, radio<br />
The prospective uniform communication standard should offer the following aspects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Global acceptance,</li>
<li>Less engineering by object oriented instruments and models,</li>
<li>Services ensuring quality, efficiency, accuracy and security of the information exchange,</li>
<li>High performance,</li>
<li>Open for extensions regarding future applications,</li>
<li>Flexibility in applying prospective innovative communication on the physical and link layers,</li>
<li>Application of mature technologies in the 7-Layer Model,</li>
<li>Interfaces to other standards and continuity in new standard extensions.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="813-standards-for-data-management"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#813-standards-for-data-management"></a> 8.1.3 Standards for Data Management</h3>
<p>Enterprise  process  management  (EPM)  systems  nowadays  are  broadly  used  to  manage  all  processes  of  the  enterprise  based  on  digital  data  bases  in  an  efficient  way.<br />
parameters of a transformer are used in the data bases of the following EPM systems for the network management:</p>
<ul>
<li>SCADA,</li>
<li>EMS (Energy management systems of TSOs) or DMS (Distribution management systems of DNOs),</li>
<li>geographical information system (GIS),</li>
<li>network planning,</li>
<li>asset management,</li>
<li>maintenance management,</li>
<li>outage management.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="814-information-security"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#814-information-security"></a> 8.1.4 Information Security</h3>
<p>Electricity networks belong to the critical infrastructure systems. The remote control and supervision of electric networks are vulnerable to several security threats like</p>
<ul>
<li>External attacks,</li>
<li>Internal attacks,</li>
<li>Natural disasters,</li>
<li>Equipment failures,</li>
<li>Carelessness,</li>
<li>Data manipulation,</li>
<li>Loss of data.</li>

<p>China became the world’s largest producer and consumer of electricity during the first decade of the 21st century.</p>
<p>The need for establishing Smart Grids in China is driven by two major objectives:</p>
<ol>
<li>Establishment of a unified national transmission system and</li>
<li>Significant growth in the use of renewable energy sources.</li>
</ol>
<p>The  Chinese  power  system  is  operated  by  seven  regional  transmission  networks.  Five of these transmission networks are managed by the State Grid Corporation of China (SGCC):</p>
<ul>
<li>NWCG—North-West China Grid,  西北电网</li>
<li>NCG—North China Grid,  华北电网</li>
<li>NECG—North-East China Grid,  中国东北电网</li>
<li>CCG—Central China Grid,  华中电网</li>
<li>ECG—East China Grid 华东电网</li>
</ul>

<p>The  China  Southern  Power  Grid  Company  Limited  (CSPGC)  is  the  second  state  owned  Chinese  transmission  enterprise  and  operates  the  China  South  Grid  CSG.</p>
<p>The  lack  of  a  unified  national  transmission  system  with  strong  interconnec-tions was a barrier to the nation-wide efficient use of the power plants and height-ens the risk of local congestions.</p>
<p>China’s  power  system  is  mainly  based  on  coal  fired  thermal  power  plants  (approximately  65%).  However,  China  is  also  the  world  champion  regarding  the  electricity  generation  based  on  renewable  energy  sources  (RES)</p>
<p>The  annual  expansion  of  wind  energy  and  PV  capacities  has  picked  up  an   enormous  pace</p>
<p>Furthermore,  China  will  soon  take  over  the  world  market  leadership  in  photo-voltaic and wind power technologies.</p>
<p>The  integration  of  China’s  growing  RES  capacity  into  the  national  power  sys-tem  requires  the  upgrade  of  the  electric  network  infrastructure  at  all  levels  and  ultimately, the establishment of a Smart Grid</p>
